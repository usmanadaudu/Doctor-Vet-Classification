I’m in an area that has a serious shortage of emergency trained vets, so much so that there’s been a pivot to regular vets not doing emergency triage, and not being able to recognize emergencies. \\n\\nIs there a basic certification that’s available so that pet owners can know when it’s time for the ER?|[deleted]|[deleted]|I agree with some of the below threads. Pay varies from state and I’ve also found big cities tend to pay more than hospitals in burbs or rural areas. For instance, I’m not certified and as a tech in Boston, MA I make $27/hour but in Chicago, IL I made $23/hour. That being said, I live with my boyfriend and having dual incomes is honestly the only way I can afford to live.\\n\\nI know moving for a job is a big thing consider but maybe not a bad idea to see what’s out there. I’ve also learned to not be afraid to advocate for yourself. Tell these jobs with the low rates that you’ve gotten more competitive offers (how will they know if you’re lying??) and drive that price up.

Just the island life is expensive.|When you get your loans the first thing taken out, before your survival needs like food water and rent, is tuition. So out of the 20k or so you’re left with 5 k to survive on for an entire semester. You can use this to your discretion. I would not take out another loan for vet prep.|I used my unsubsidized loan for vetprep. I took out the max approved amount.|Wait. I’m talking about vet prep. It’s an online navle study system. Not anything with the school. It’s 700 bucks.|I had enough of my own savings to pay for everything other than tuition the first two years. My family paid for tuition the first half. The remainder of vet school I used federal unsubsidized loans. Whatever I was approved for I took out. I did not use any grad plus loans or private loans. My mother paid for my rent the last two years. I had 0 debt from undergrad|So total cost of having permission to be in the building and on the vet school roster was 240k with living expenses included. They didn’t teach me anything I didn’t know.

Nothing can prepare you for the amount of bullshit they want you to know. It’s just memory games. You don’t learn anything until you start practicing.|I hated school.

I was not a fan of school by any means. I love the profession though outside of academia.|Please lemme know to if anyone can recommend any equine vet related stuff maybe ?|Even though they count for credits. You will still have to pay the same amount for the next semester. I maxed out my externship credits hoping I would lower my costs the next semester in lesser required electives.

Wasn’t till the third time, that I was out of school not being forced to work in the clinic 80 hours a week making salads for tortoises or soaps for doctors that I had time to actually sleep and study. Also go to a doctor and get ur blood and hormones checked. I found out I was low testosterone and it definitely helped me pass starting TRT. I put off going to the doctor for 6 years total because of vet school. Was just too busy. But vet prep. Try to do the questions in 1 hour blocks on the timed section and then take a 20 min break. Then go back and read all the explanations. If you don’t understand something. Then go to Merck and read about it. That’s what I did.|Focus on getting into vet school first. It’s extremely difficult. Then focus on passing the courses. The course load is nothing like you’ll ever experience in ur life. They force 8 years of education down ur throat in 4 years  and then demand you pass a 360 question test on rediculous veterinary knowledge before you can get ur license. While ur on clinics you will see if you like the internship/academia approach. Dont worry about specialties now. Focus on getting in and how the f you’re gonna pay for it.|The vet schools are atrocious what they are able to get away with in the US. JUST ABOUT 130k for in state tuition, or 220k for out of state. And that doesn’t include insurance, living expenses, etc.  Every grade is based on one multiple choice test and you have to read the class notes to pass so there’s No point in going to lecture. They force you to be a glorified technician in clinics and work absurd hours because there are no regulations on student labor. During corona they abused the fuck out of us. You just wear a white coat so everyone knows you’re paying to be a slave. Go to wherever is cheapest and study like hell for navle. My school didn’t prepare me for navle. I wish I went to Germany. They just force you to assimilate to their country. Which is reasonable imo. Just difficult while learning medicine and German culture.|Atleast on the timer section. Since the test is in April there is not much time to complete the timed and not timed sections.|If you are retaking in April. Really focus on practice questions. Especially timed ones. Then read the explanations. It covers the most material and removes the time wasted you will take making guided and study materials. I used vet prep. The third time I competed it to 97 percent. I passed test this time. Maybe use zuku. I also would read a little additional in material on the questions , whether I got wrong or right on Merck veterinary manual.|I viewed vet prep not as similar to navle, but as a fun way to learn the material. It was much better to learn and read through the question format than to just read random info all day. Challenging yourself to do well and get questions right was way more fun. What was annoying was reading all the explanations but it really reinforced the information about the species and random facts you may need to know or see.|I really want you to pass. Cause waiting till next November sucks so much. It’s what I had to do. Take as many vacation and sick days from school to study. I focused too much on not failing school cause I told myself I could retake the navle for 700 but if I mess up a semester I have to pay 30k plus living expenses for a year repeat.|Focus on the power pages and the powerlectures on questions you really don’t get.

You are only on this earth once. Do what you want. Just know vet school is full of hormonal women who aren’t married that think education and a career will fill that hole. It was a miserable time for me as a man. I just kept my mouth shut as much as a could and went home immediately from school. Found the cool guys in the class to hang with. The residents were so fuckin miserable cause they get paid next to nothing and could’ve gone right out into private practice to make tons of money. Just know you need good grades and a tough class cload to prove to you handle the demands of vet school. It is designed so that you cannot work while being vet school. They spread 8 years of education over 4 years and you are taking a new class every few weeks while 4 other classes over lap and end at random times while new ones start. Clinics you need to work against your will and your opinion means nothing and will sometimes even bother the residents if you know more. They take it as a challenge to their authority rather than you caring about the patient and the medicine; because they’re mostly women. But I would do it again. I learned a lot about women and will probably never get married.|A lot of ERs do mentorship but you\\'ll need to ask around. \\n\\nIf you wanna dip ur toe- Modern Animal does some urgent care. I know they do both GP and urgent care so it\\'s a nice mix. No clue about pay logistics etc, but this is appealing for those who wanna do a mix. \\n\\nPersonally would not recommend an internship! Most ERs don\\'t care about it and have new grad type programs/mentorships that would service you faaaar better in terms of pay, experience, and overall progress. Internships where I am in California are like 70k for 80 hour weeks (including being on call nights, like maybe a week of PTO etc.). You\\'ll probably get really proficent at surgery and very comfortable, but at what cost? New grad vets at the emergency i work at (i\\'m a tech there, but a vet student as well) start at 125k as new grads. They have mentorship, a schedule for being comfortable/proficent with surgeries etc. You\\'ll get more than enough experience going straight into ER as a new grad role. I know they have something about a variety of different surgeries that needed to be signed off by a more senior doctor (watching a GI surgery, doing a GI surgery etc.)|Highly circumstance and location dependent.  You need a lawyer with experience in non-competes to answer these types of questions.  I would not make a potentially huge financial decision such as this based on what other redditors have experienced.|I hope someone sues the living hell out of this organization and that they lose the contract for this test for licensing. In no way is it any test of veterinary competence. It is merely only for hazing. Since the previous gen had to take it, so do we and it never changes. I have no idea how unclear questions of communication, seahorse euthanasia, and pig diarrhea have to do with me doing dentals, surgery, and physical exams every day. I had 0 questions on anesthesia, 1 on surgery. And veterinary schools are horrible as well. I never was able to, or taught to extract one tooth during my education. I merely paid to be a glorified technician in a white coat and to show up and be told all my thoughts are wrong because i had too much experience in private practice. Every test was multiple choice and tested no ability other than to regurg random garbage the professor thought were cool.|I am so sorry you didn’t pass. I had to take it three times. Passed by razor think margins this time but that all that matters. My advice. Complete vetprep. And the last month, I was only doing questions in 1 hour sections. Maybe 4-5 times a day. But I additionally read every answer explanation after too. I was able to quit my job and move home and study really hard. Beating this rediculous test is all about studying, training for the 7 hour grind, and hopefully getting a test with questions you know you can answer correctly.|Only 5 times.

The extra time you get for breaks and to take the second half the next day sounded awesome. For me it didn’t help. Either I knew the answer or I didn’t. Really focus on the epidemiology. Those are freebies if you understand the specificity and sensitivity questions. I would try to complete vet prep and use the timed section the most. Use the non timed questions when you’re just relaxing but take time to do 1hour sections similar to the test. I can’t tell you how much it helped my stamina and to view the test as sections rather than individual questions. It also helps you make quicker decisions on questions you don’t know so you can focus on some questions you can reason out. Just such a bad test. They need to get rid of it.|They remove all the bad questions, after the test has been taken. How intelligent right? Rather than making sure the test has fair questions before it is taken…. Genius.|Focus on vet school first. It mostly degrades your will to want to stay in academia. It is extremely toxic. If anything, surgery alone is the best speciality because you learn how to fix things and too many vets in the field refuse to do surgery for 1 not having the time, two not being able to charge appropriately, and 3 they can make more money doing rooms. Internal medicine you can teach yourself. Also…the schools rely on radiology to do the ultrasounds where in private practice, if you want to get anything done as an internist, you need to learn how to ultrasound and interpret yourself. So I would get ur DVM. Work for a year. Then go do an ultrasonography course  where they teach you in a group how to scan. Then study internal medicine yourself. Surgery though, you really gotta do the internship residency route. You still don’t have to get boarded. But you will have to publish some bs paper and waste that time. Unless you are able to find a mentor to teach you privately.|I wonder whos results they are.|I’m surprised how many vets accept a position with negative accrual.  With how many clinics need vets this should be something that can be removed from the system.  Vets have more leverage than employers do right now and it likely will stay that way for a long time.|This is called negative accrual, this is not standard in all contracts.  If it is on yours I would suggest negotiating it out or taking a different position.  There are too many open positions around the country to accept negative accrual as a norm in pay structures.

Is the $120K the difference in the cost of schooling itself? I think you should think of the following:\\n\\n* Flights home to see family  / friends. Could cost at least $1K per trip minimum\\n* Cost of living (food, housing, etc.) will be a lot higher in England than Baton Rouge\\n* Does becoming a permanent resident or citizen of England mean anything to you? That could be a big positive for the England route\\n*  Investigate immigration status in England. Sometimes study permits don\\'t allow you to qualify for national health insurance scheme. Might be more $ for a private insurance plan or a school sponsored plan\\n\\nAnd many more nuances that come with international moving. With that said, only you can decide if it\\'s worth it.

A good one will pay decent but you’re not gonna be rich\\n- you will have to cut open dead rats, bunnies, and other and sometimes break their bones to make portions for raptors and scavengers\\n- depending on the animal, you can get hurt but if you’re doing ur job right it won’t be severe. Just bites/scratches. It’s only a problem with rabies vectors but idk any professional who’s gotten bit and you have to have the vaccine to be able to work with them\\n- some days ur gonna get gross, that’s what scrubs are for\\n- some animals will have parasites on their body and they will often crawl up your arm or you find them a few hours later bc they’re so little. It’s feather lice primarily bc ticks are usually attached and feather lice will fall off in a day or two bc we don’t have feathers but that is the main thing I do not like.

So having more knowledge of that work prior to your vet school experience will help you. It\\'s a small field and hard to break into. If you\\'re thinking capture and immobilization of let\\'s say bears for research a lot of that is done with PhD\\'s so maybe get in touch with a school that has a wildlife department and talk out best steps.

Took me three tries. I can’t tell u how brutal first and second year were because of anatomy and the lecture load. I felt the same. I would get a D and study harder only to get a C-. Once I realized this is not a test of intelligence, these vet school tests are a test of memory I stopped caring so much and just make it about memory. You have to find ways to memorize shit with mneumonjcs and stuf that your brain wants to remember. Just know it’s there to prepare you for the amount of BS you need to force urself to study for navle. It may have 0 use in the clinic but some people believe it all makes sense by graduation; The anatomy first year, then pathology second year, clinics 3rd year, and electives 4th year with some more clinics.  By the end it all makes sense together. Vet medicine is a monster. Idk where I’d start with teaching. I just wish we didn’t need to focus on all that large animal bs. Such a waste of time. Just with clinics, keep ur mouth shut and pretend ur dumb. Most residents and interns will see you as a challenge to their authority if you make recommendations better than them. Atleast in my experience.

It is an expensive journey and filled with insane amounts of stress. I wouldn’t have chosen anything else. But getting as much experience will greatly improve the stats you will get accepted to a vet school. You need very good grades and a very high class load to prove you can handle vet school.

Quote some stats of how frequently this occurs if the dog is not strictly exercise restricted after surgery.  It might be a bit passive-aggressive, but it’s one way of showing them it was not your fault. It’s a way of teaching the techs that 1) you do have the knowledge and 2) your tech might be more at fault for allowing too much activity too soon.\\nI often use my conversations with clients as an indirect way to teach my techs. I come from a ER/ICU background, and I do many things differently (and more “purist”) than the other docs at the GP where I work.|These happen from activity.

Well its not impossible but it\\'ll require some extra effort if ur looking  to do navle without vet prep... I personally studied initially by making my own notes from a no of sources.. i followed the list of diseases given by ICVA.. after 3 months of doing that i started preparing using Vetprep... since i practiced in a clinic aswell.. the clinical experience also helped.. but i could answer about 80% of those vetprep questions easily i could say.... So you can study for navle  without vetprep but its difficult.. and will require more time... and then there is a chance of not passing navle on the first try... so paying for vetprep is better than paying navle twice... I hope this helps..\\n Incase if youd need any help in ur preparation you can hit me up...|Kuru sneakers and compression socks.

For the lunging dogs, nope.|Was working about 60 hrs/week in ER/ICU when I decided it was now or never. I was CRAZY into my job, loved the intensity, the level of medicine, the focus on learning, and the great team I was a part of. But I was 33, knew I wanted more than one kid, and didn’t want to have kids when I was over forty. \\nAnd so it began - the shift from a full throttle ER/ICU vet, to a full throttle mom of five fantastic kids whom I ended up homeschooling for 9 years (7 years before Covid hit.). \\nIt began with a miscarriage during an overnight shift - fun times - then five babies in a span of 5.5 years (no twins.)\\nI went back to work after 3 months for the first and second, but worked weird hours (like 6 hour shifts) so that I would spend most of the days with them. After my fifth, I took a year off. \\nMy two oldest kids, now 21 and 20, were reminiscing recently about how sad they used to be when I went to work, because they felt like they wouldn’t see me again forever. \\nOne day I came home and found my oldest kid, about 7 at the time, missing an eyebrow. Dad - apparently my sixth child- had bet him $22 that he wouldn’t shave off an eyebrow. He did. Every time I worked, it seemed, stuff would happen.\\nOne day I was just leaning in to intubate an unconscious, cyanotic Pomeranian when I was paged. My husband was calling from the back of an ambulance, on the way to the hospital with my son who was gushing blood out his ear. (Backstory: Apparently he and his brother had been pretending to be dinosaurs by putting Q-tips in their ears, and jumping on the bed. Little guy fell on the bed, on the Q-tip, and of course it ruptured his ear drum and had to be surgically repaired with a graft. But I digress.)\\nAnyway, while leaning over that blue dog, chanting to my panicking self, “First save the dog. You can’t change the ambulance situation” was the moment I realized I just had to be home. \\nI took several years off except for a rare relief shift. When I started back, I had lost 99% of my confidence. It was awful and it was terrifying.\\nI’m 100% glad I was home with my kids while they were young but it’s almost a miracle that I had the guts to return.\\nIf I had it to do over, I guess I would have made it a point to do like one shift a month.\\nI started back by doing some vaccine clinics (shhh), then GP relief, then back to ER.  When my youngest got to high school age, I took on more shifts, but I still usually work shorter shifts (9-4, 4-11) because I want to be around for them. I do relief only so that I can schedule work around every one of their hockey games and saxophone performances. I refuse to miss ANYthing they do!\\nMy focus is 100% my kids. No longer my career. Don’t get me wrong - I’m super diligent and thorough with work when I work - but I work because it’s what I do with my time when my kids don’t need me. \\nHaving a baby will change your career, but there is nothing wrong with that. It doesn’t make it worse, just different. \\nGood luck!|I wrote a long reply to OP, but want to share my experience with you. I had 5 kids in 5.5 years, and never went back full time. I was (and am) all-in as a parent.\\nMy one regret is that I ended up taking a few years off while I was homeschooling four of my five (long before covid.)  Those homeschooling years were the absolute BEST, but to return to practice after that was terrifying because I had lost all confidence in my ability. If you do take time away, consider doing a relief shift once a month or so, just to keep that door open.|I hear ya on all that!  I would not mind if something I was passionate about that paid well landed in my lap! But I will say, being able to do relief work so that I can choose exactly when I want to work (“I can come in from 9-12, will that be helpful?”) has been a godsend. I am able to work enough to pay for everything they need, but still be around for them. \\nHaving kids close in age is awesome. Really really hard when they are little, but so much fun once they can all pee in the potty and buckle their own seatbelts!|Vegan pet food?

I’m in an area that has a serious shortage of emergency trained vets, so much so that there’s been a pivot to regular vets not doing emergency triage, and not being able to recognize emergencies. \\n\\nIs there a basic certification that’s available so that pet owners can know when it’s time for the ER?|[deleted]|[deleted]|I agree with some of the below threads. Pay varies from state and I’ve also found big cities tend to pay more than hospitals in burbs or rural areas. For instance, I’m not certified and as a tech in Boston, MA I make $27/hour but in Chicago, IL I made $23/hour. That being said, I live with my boyfriend and having dual incomes is honestly the only way I can afford to live.\\n\\nI know moving for a job is a big thing consider but maybe not a bad idea to see what’s out there. I’ve also learned to not be afraid to advocate for yourself. Tell these jobs with the low rates that you’ve gotten more competitive offers (how will they know if you’re lying??) and drive that price up. CVT are a hot commodity and the right hospital is willing to pay you for your expertist!|[deleted]|A new technician started a few months ago, and the way they treat her is awful, I’ve caught her crying out back in the kennel area. And I don’t think she’s doing a bad job at all. I’m getting sick of the toxic people.|Oh yeah there’s insubordination. I ask them to do something like ice incisions post-surgery and get a bunch of pushback. Because “no one else asks us to do this.” Every week I have to remind them and what seems like such a small, easy task gets attitude.|Nope! I never say anything to anyone about cases other vets have seen. I keep my mouth shut. I have seen some of my colleagues do that to each other, so I really keep to myself.|Haha I just hate confrontation. The kennel staff have told me that I am the nicest person in the whole building and have thanked me for giving them respect. I just don’t understand being nasty to someone else. I wonder what makes people act that way.|Stay the course and follow your dream. \\nPerhaps look into exotic/wildlife services you could volunteer with to see if this is a path you might want to specialise in?|[deleted]|[deleted]|[deleted]|Promising, but nothing is final until you’ve signed a contract.|Did you sign anything or have paperwork from your current job on the pay rise?|[deleted]|[deleted]|Ill keep that in mind, appreciate it!|Thanks for the tips and the heads up|[deleted]|[deleted]|[deleted]|[deleted]|This very interesting bc he runs the vet student hospital shadowing days- when you\\'re in ur first and second year, you get 4 days each year to shadow a 4th year vet student. Students were told they couldn\\'t leave by the faculty running each rotation, when apparently, the faculty know that we aren\\'t supposed to stay past 6pm. (Most rotations, we get there 7-8am, so we are having 10-11 hour days minimum.) Dr. C is the one who told us to absoutely tell faculty that we can leave at 6pm and it\\'s really sad to me that when he\\'s telling us to stand up for ourselves, that isn\\'t true for the resident programs. Such a bummer bc he\\'s always seemed so nice.\\n\\nIt gives the feeling of \"I struggled thru all this with my residency and did well so yall should too\"|[deleted]|i\\'m only speaking for the shadowing rotations we do as 1/2nd years anyways. i\\'ve worked with Dr. C for many handling labs and he\\'s always been kind! since his teaching role includes the shadowing program he was the one who told us to leave at 6pm when we shadow 4th years.|[deleted]|[deleted]|[deleted]|[deleted]|i\\'m emergency in california and get paid 21/hr. on that i still wouldnt be able to afford a place alone, would need 2-3 roomates and rent would be 30-40% of my income depending on if ur lucky for a good deal or not....|I\\'ve decided that I want to study vet science when after I graduate, but I hate that I\\'ll study something that I have near to zero knowledge about. Are there any textbooks that can provide a brief amount of knowledge about vet science? I\\'ve found some textbooks online but they all seem its for students who are going to specialize in something. Any help?|[deleted]|[deleted]|[deleted]|[deleted]|[deleted]|[removed]|[removed]|[deleted]|[deleted]|internships are almost always required and lately most people have had to do 2 :/. you need them for letters of rec from 4 other board certified specialists|Agree with this. More options is not always better. More options is more you don\\'t know and you\\'re trying to weed thru more surface level stuff (in my school you can only do 4 externships so no way you can figure out 10 different places!)|How old are you and is there any chance you can wait a year and apply to a state school? Just asking because the expenses to live on the island and travel in addition to tuition. It’s a great school though. Just the island life is expensive.|When you get your loans the first thing taken out, before your survival needs like food water and rent, is tuition. So out of the 20k or so you’re left with 5 k to survive on for an entire semester. You can use this to your discretion. I would not take out another loan for vet prep.|I used my unsubsidized loan for vetprep. I took out the max approved amount.|Wait. I’m talking about vet prep. It’s an online navle study system. Not anything with the school. It’s 700 bucks.|I had enough of my own savings to pay for everything other than tuition the first two years. My family paid for tuition the first half. The remainder of vet school I used federal unsubsidized loans. Whatever I was approved for I took out. I did not use any grad plus loans or private loans. My mother paid for my rent the last two years. I had 0 debt from undergrad|So total cost of having permission to be in the building and on the vet school roster was 240k with living expenses included. They didn’t teach me anything I didn’t know. I simply paid to become eligible for NAVLE and to be a glorified tech on their floor. I hated school.|Whoops. Oh I would never have do a program prior to vet school. Nothing can prepare you for the amount of bullshit they want you to know. It’s just memory games. You don’t learn anything until you start practicing.|I hated school. They worked us like slaves in the clinic. Then wasnt able to pass navle because of it. Once i had 5 months to study without working like a slave I was able to pass. I was not a fan of school by any means. I love the profession though outside of academia.|Please lemme know to if anyone can recommend any equine vet related stuff maybe ?|Even though they count for credits. You will still have to pay the same amount for the next semester. I maxed out my externship credits hoping I would lower my costs the next semester in lesser required electives. NOPE. paid 15k for 10 credits. Fing scam. Use the externships to check out where you wanna work. If you don’t like it…tell them you’re going onto an internship.|Love vet med. you can always be learning. You get the puzzles and challenges of medicine without dealing with humans full time. You can always learn more by opening a book and staying sharp. You can always be improving your practices. You can work wherever you want to work. It pays great if you work hard. Love it so much. So glad I just passed navle. Can’t wait to start my career.|I don’t let others borrow my instruments. If I do, I don’t leave the room till I get them back. Everything I have was given to me by a mentor or has been through hell with me.|I stuck with vet prep. Wasn’t till the third time, that I was out of school not being forced to work in the clinic 80 hours a week making salads for tortoises or soaps for doctors that I had time to actually sleep and study. Also go to a doctor and get ur blood and hormones checked. I found out I was low testosterone and it definitely helped me pass starting TRT. I put off going to the doctor for 6 years total because of vet school. Was just too busy. But vet prep. Try to do the questions in 1 hour blocks on the timed section and then take a 20 min break. Then go back and read all the explanations. If you don’t understand something. Then go to Merck and read about it. That’s what I did.|Focus on getting into vet school first. It’s extremely difficult. Then focus on passing the courses. The course load is nothing like you’ll ever experience in ur life. They force 8 years of education down ur throat in 4 years  and then demand you pass a 360 question test on rediculous veterinary knowledge before you can get ur license. While ur on clinics you will see if you like the internship/academia approach. Dont worry about specialties now. Focus on getting in and how the f you’re gonna pay for it.|The vet schools are atrocious what they are able to get away with in the US. JUST ABOUT 130k for in state tuition, or 220k for out of state. And that doesn’t include insurance, living expenses, etc.  Every grade is based on one multiple choice test and you have to read the class notes to pass so there’s No point in going to lecture. They force you to be a glorified technician in clinics and work absurd hours because there are no regulations on student labor. During corona they abused the fuck out of us. You just wear a white coat so everyone knows you’re paying to be a slave. Go to wherever is cheapest and study like hell for navle. My school didn’t prepare me for navle. I wish I went to Germany. They just force you to assimilate to their country. Which is reasonable imo. Just difficult while learning medicine and German culture.|Atleast on the timer section. Since the test is in April there is not much time to complete the timed and not timed sections.|If you are retaking in April. Really focus on practice questions. Especially timed ones. Then read the explanations. It covers the most material and removes the time wasted you will take making guided and study materials. I used vet prep. The third time I competed it to 97 percent. I passed test this time. Maybe use zuku. I also would read a little additional in material on the questions , whether I got wrong or right on Merck veterinary manual.|I viewed vet prep not as similar to navle, but as a fun way to learn the material. It was much better to learn and read through the question format than to just read random info all day. Challenging yourself to do well and get questions right was way more fun. What was annoying was reading all the explanations but it really reinforced the information about the species and random facts you may need to know or see.|I really want you to pass. Cause waiting till next November sucks so much. It’s what I had to do. Take as many vacation and sick days from school to study. I focused too much on not failing school cause I told myself I could retake the navle for 700 but if I mess up a semester I have to pay 30k plus living expenses for a year repeat.|Focus on the power pages and the powerlectures on questions you really don’t get. Like I had to rewatch pig diarrhea and respiratory diseases 10 times. Just to understand 5 percent of it. But I’m pretty sure I got a porcine coronavirus question right because of it.|would you be willing to share where/what company? or dm me? super interested in a place where i could rotate between small exotics and emergency/iurgent care!!|Code Fred|Never too late to do what you want to do. You are only on this earth once. Do what you want. Just know vet school is full of hormonal women who aren’t married that think education and a career will fill that hole. It was a miserable time for me as a man. I just kept my mouth shut as much as a could and went home immediately from school. Found the cool guys in the class to hang with. The residents were so fuckin miserable cause they get paid next to nothing and could’ve gone right out into private practice to make tons of money. Just know you need good grades and a tough class cload to prove to you handle the demands of vet school. It is designed so that you cannot work while being vet school. They spread 8 years of education over 4 years and you are taking a new class every few weeks while 4 other classes over lap and end at random times while new ones start. Clinics you need to work against your will and your opinion means nothing and will sometimes even bother the residents if you know more. They take it as a challenge to their authority rather than you caring about the patient and the medicine; because they’re mostly women. But I would do it again. I learned a lot about women and will probably never get married.|A lot of ERs do mentorship but you\\'ll need to ask around. \\n\\nIf you wanna dip ur toe- Modern Animal does some urgent care. I know they do both GP and urgent care so it\\'s a nice mix. No clue about pay logistics etc, but this is appealing for those who wanna do a mix. \\n\\nPersonally would not recommend an internship! Most ERs don\\'t care about it and have new grad type programs/mentorships that would service you faaaar better in terms of pay, experience, and overall progress. Internships where I am in California are like 70k for 80 hour weeks (including being on call nights, like maybe a week of PTO etc.). You\\'ll probably get really proficent at surgery and very comfortable, but at what cost? New grad vets at the emergency i work at (i\\'m a tech there, but a vet student as well) start at 125k as new grads. They have mentorship, a schedule for being comfortable/proficent with surgeries etc. You\\'ll get more than enough experience going straight into ER as a new grad role. I know they have something about a variety of different surgeries that needed to be signed off by a more senior doctor (watching a GI surgery, doing a GI surgery etc.)|Highly circumstance and location dependent.  You need a lawyer with experience in non-competes to answer these types of questions.  I would not make a potentially huge financial decision such as this based on what other redditors have experienced.|I hope someone sues the living hell out of this organization and that they lose the contract for this test for licensing. In no way is it any test of veterinary competence. It is merely only for hazing. Since the previous gen had to take it, so do we and it never changes. I have no idea how unclear questions of communication, seahorse euthanasia, and pig diarrhea have to do with me doing dentals, surgery, and physical exams every day. I had 0 questions on anesthesia, 1 on surgery. And veterinary schools are horrible as well. I never was able to, or taught to extract one tooth during my education. I merely paid to be a glorified technician in a white coat and to show up and be told all my thoughts are wrong because i had too much experience in private practice. Every test was multiple choice and tested no ability other than to regurg random garbage the professor thought were cool.|I am so sorry you didn’t pass. I had to take it three times. Passed by razor think margins this time but that all that matters. My advice. Complete vetprep. And the last month, I was only doing questions in 1 hour sections. Maybe 4-5 times a day. But I additionally read every answer explanation after too. I was able to quit my job and move home and study really hard. Beating this rediculous test is all about studying, training for the 7 hour grind, and hopefully getting a test with questions you know you can answer correctly.|Only 5 times. For a low price of 700 plus 500 for study materias|If failed again im getting my CDL and becoming a truck driver. Fuck it. Clearly my education was flawed and didn’t prepare me for what the ICVA deems as medically appropriate knowledge for practice. Like fish euthanasia, chicken feet pathology and llama reproduction.\\n\\n-I passed. I still don’t like the test. What a waste of time and money. And now I’m behind on my loans already.|Someone in my class got like a 750. I wanted to mri her brain. The ability to study against one’s will to that extent. Sheesh.|Always 425 and a roll of the dice that you got enough questions right. 3rd time taking this awful garbage pos test. Every year they find a way to make it nothing like vet prep and ask questions that are completely irrelevant.|In the real world. Cap the needle, separate the syringe and throw the needle away in the red bin and throw the syringe in the garbage to save on hazmat fees. They weigh the containers and bill. The test answer would be to throw the whole syringe in the red bin, don’t recap it.|To take a test that you’re either completely lucky you get questions you know or hopefully you get a score report from someone else that’s passing.|Yes get accommodations even if you don’t need the time for the questions. The extra time you get for breaks and to take the second half the next day sounded awesome. For me it didn’t help. Either I knew the answer or I didn’t. Really focus on the epidemiology. Those are freebies if you understand the specificity and sensitivity questions. I would try to complete vet prep and use the timed section the most. Use the non timed questions when you’re just relaxing but take time to do 1hour sections similar to the test. I can’t tell you how much it helped my stamina and to view the test as sections rather than individual questions. It also helps you make quicker decisions on questions you don’t know so you can focus on some questions you can reason out. Just such a bad test. They need to get rid of it.|They remove all the bad questions, after the test has been taken. How intelligent right? Rather than making sure the test has fair questions before it is taken…. Genius.|Focus on vet school first. It mostly degrades your will to want to stay in academia. It is extremely toxic. If anything, surgery alone is the best speciality because you learn how to fix things and too many vets in the field refuse to do surgery for 1 not having the time, two not being able to charge appropriately, and 3 they can make more money doing rooms. Internal medicine you can teach yourself. Also…the schools rely on radiology to do the ultrasounds where in private practice, if you want to get anything done as an internist, you need to learn how to ultrasound and interpret yourself. So I would get ur DVM. Work for a year. Then go do an ultrasonography course  where they teach you in a group how to scan. Then study internal medicine yourself. Surgery though, you really gotta do the internship residency route. You still don’t have to get boarded. But you will have to publish some bs paper and waste that time. Unless you are able to find a mentor to teach you privately.|I wonder whos results they are.|I’m surprised how many vets accept a position with negative accrual.  With how many clinics need vets this should be something that can be removed from the system.  Vets have more leverage than employers do right now and it likely will stay that way for a long time.|This is called negative accrual, this is not standard in all contracts.  If it is on yours I would suggest negotiating it out or taking a different position.  There are too many open positions around the country to accept negative accrual as a norm in pay structures.  You should be able to enjoy your vacation.|AVMA and WSVMA are the typical places jobs are posted in WA to my knowledge.  Some post in other locals but those are the standard places to post.|I mean what would really happen if you just left?\\xa0|Tips on getting these jobs without an mph?\\xa0|Yeah I avoided an internship because I figured I would put all the energy and stress the internship would demand of me in studying on my own time in private practice. They do not appear to be like they used to from the vets that inspired me to go to vet school. They graduated in the 80s. The internships and residencies appear to me to be more of working insane hours for insanely low pay. And then when ur done. Where are u supposed to practice at that level. There is a huge tech shortage and no clinics I know of with competent 24/7 care (south Florida).|There are a lot of great resources in learn.idexx.com the Idexx learning center if you can access that in India. A lot of continuing education on hematology.\\xa0|I currently use DaySmart (formerly Vetter) and I use multiple tabs all the time so that would be frustrating for me.  I am not enamored with daysmart, but I am not as unhappy as you sound w/Pulse.  I am thinking of merging with a practice that is currently on Pulse and was debating sticking w/Daysmart vs. swapping to their product.  Thanks|First off, I\\'m not a vet. Is the $120K the difference in the cost of schooling itself? I think you should think of the following:\\n\\n* Flights home to see family  / friends. Could cost at least $1K per trip minimum\\n* Cost of living (food, housing, etc.) will be a lot higher in England than Baton Rouge\\n* Does becoming a permanent resident or citizen of England mean anything to you? That could be a big positive for the England route\\n*  Investigate immigration status in England. Sometimes study permits don\\'t allow you to qualify for national health insurance scheme. Might be more $ for a private insurance plan or a school sponsored plan\\n\\nAnd many more nuances that come with international moving. With that said, only you can decide if it\\'s worth it. I find it sometimes helps to flip the question: If you were planning to go to England for vet school and someone said \"I\\'ll pay you $120K to go to LSU instead, all else being equal\", would you do it?|You are welcome!

Wildlife rehabilitation/rescue has become my life’s passion.\\n\\nCouple things you have to know\\n- you want to find GOOD rehab centers to learn from. Well funded and highly professional. Not one where nobody is monitoring volunteers and animals can get killed on accident from carelessness. It’s more than them having a good vet- it’s gotta be the way it’s run\\n- it is a very very high amount of euthanasia and that’s not for everybody. My brain sees it as a treatment for the untreatable and giving them respect/peace and am grateful for it. But I can’t do pet euthanasias emotionally 🤷🏼\\u200d♀️ everyone’s different\\n- it’s not rolling in money. A good one will pay decent but you’re not gonna be rich\\n- you will have to cut open dead rats, bunnies, and other and sometimes break their bones to make portions for raptors and scavengers\\n- depending on the animal, you can get hurt but if you’re doing ur job right it won’t be severe. Just bites/scratches. It’s only a problem with rabies vectors but idk any professional who’s gotten bit and you have to have the vaccine to be able to work with them\\n- some days ur gonna get gross, that’s what scrubs are for\\n- some animals will have parasites on their body and they will often crawl up your arm or you find them a few hours later bc they’re so little. It’s feather lice primarily bc ticks are usually attached and feather lice will fall off in a day or two bc we don’t have feathers but that is the main thing I do not like. Nobody told me and then I found some on my arm or leg and was like “where is this coming from”\\n\\nSome people can work in education for rehab centers that have resident animals that cannot be released into the wild. This is sometimes controversial but everywhere I’ve worked has had them|Wish I could say the same as a wildlife specialty 😅😅😭😭 but the joy I get is worth it|😂|You have SO much time. I completely switched my animal focus and my entire path. Some people go to vet school years after they graduate college. Go get a degree in animal science or zoology IMO. You’re gonna have to deal with mainly not working with animals everyday for undergrad unless you’re working- it will get you to your goal in the long run.|That’s what I wish I did instead of a directly vet focused undergrad.

Just my 2cents.|Best recommendation I can give you: find a veterinary job that isn’t working face to face with owners/clients. Changed my life|This is why we have a vet shortage! Pay for 4 years of vet school just to make 1/5 of a human doctor and be 3x more likely to unalive yourself? System has to change|Midline. Taught in poland, practiced in UK but noone said anything about me going flank|I think the people that do this generally do wildlife biology as undergraduate degrees and maybe get an additional master\\'s in wildlife biology first. You will not get ANY training on wildlife in vet school. Being a zoo/exotics/wildlife vet requires you to be a comparative biologist. Take what we know/have for domestics and apply to the species you\\'re working on. A lot of fact finding for papers to get protocols, etc... So having more knowledge of that work prior to your vet school experience will help you. It\\'s a small field and hard to break into. If you\\'re thinking capture and immobilization of let\\'s say bears for research a lot of that is done with PhD\\'s so maybe get in touch with a school that has a wildlife department and talk out best steps. If you\\'re thinking rehabilitation, then you\\'re typically doing that work on the side. If you\\'re thinking zoo then you\\'ll generally need a residency after vet school.|I work with wildlife so I don’t have to interact with owner ethics (thank god) but I remember in practice interviews in school they would give us situations like these and ask what we would do- very interesting discussion!|Just passed navle here. Took me three tries. I can’t tell u how brutal first and second year were because of anatomy and the lecture load. I felt the same. I would get a D and study harder only to get a C-. Once I realized this is not a test of intelligence, these vet school tests are a test of memory I stopped caring so much and just make it about memory. You have to find ways to memorize shit with mneumonjcs and stuf that your brain wants to remember. Just know it’s there to prepare you for the amount of BS you need to force urself to study for navle. It may have 0 use in the clinic but some people believe it all makes sense by graduation; The anatomy first year, then pathology second year, clinics 3rd year, and electives 4th year with some more clinics.  By the end it all makes sense together. Vet medicine is a monster. Idk where I’d start with teaching. I just wish we didn’t need to focus on all that large animal bs. Such a waste of time. Just with clinics, keep ur mouth shut and pretend ur dumb. Most residents and interns will see you as a challenge to their authority if you make recommendations better than them. Atleast in my experience. What I really really learned from vet school was where to look up information and how to back up what I wanted to do medically with sound medical reasoning.|Push you to ur limits of studying random information against ur will. Even Einstein said he found it pointless to memorize random facts you can look up in a book. Test was a huge waste of time I could’ve been helping patients and contributing to vet med.|During undergrad, I took a long leave of absence during which I worked at a veterinary clinic as vet assistant for 2 years.

And take the summers off. You’re gonna need it. You don’t need to be smart for vet school. You just need good memory and test taking skills. You do need to be intelligent to be a veterinarian. School was a joke tho. Everything was multiple choice. Not one written exam.|Cover as much as you can. But at UF it didn’t seem to matter. The boarded surgeon had a sleeve.   Pretty badass. They just better be sick tattoos. lol. Hopefully they’re not explicit or sexual.|Work in as many different vet clinics as possible. Make sure it’s really what you want to do. It is an expensive journey and filled with insane amounts of stress. I wouldn’t have chosen anything else. But getting as much experience will greatly improve the stats you will get accepted to a vet school. You need very good grades and a very high class load to prove you can handle vet school. Look at a schedule of a vet school to see how crazy it is too. You don’t get to pick much. You’re strapped in for the ride taking 5 classes at a time that would take all semester in undergrad but finish only in weeks in vet school.|Thank u!|Spend a week volunteering with the horses at Best Friends in Utah. They also might have internships available.|The two places I work, the techs always ask the docs if we need them to do anything else before they leave. The lead tech can certainly send them home early to avoid OT or whatever, but they still touch base with their docs before leaving.\\nIt’s not so much for permission, though - it’s just making sure the jobs are done.

Obviously it’s ideal to graduate and have this career as an option for a solid income with really flexible hours. I’m a parent of six, homeschooled my kids for 9 years, and have been able to be there for every hockey game, every Shakespeare performance, every riding lesson, every sleepover because I do relief work.\\nAs for things you don’t know and can’t remember? You will learn 90% of what you need to know in practice after you get out of school. The learning NEVER ends.\\nBut your kids. It breaks my heart to hear that your little kids have to be cared for by someone who is angry and scary and mad at them.  This can’t go on.  How can you find a way for your precious kids to be safe and happy, while you can finish school?  This is what you need to focus on.  I would start interviewing nannies or babysitters, and remember that it’s not forever…it’s to get you to the finish line (or really the starting line of opportunity) while keeping your kiddos safe and happy. Again, unpopular opinion here, but  for me personally? I would sacrifice absolutely everything if I didn’t trust that my little ones were safe - both emotionally and physically - while I was away.|OP said her husband and his short temper are a big part of the problem|Isn’t this really hard for you to track?|Agree. I know many disagree with me, but there is no way that our practice of medicine should be influenced by production incentive.|Oh that’s good. In my second job, we were salaried with no production incentive, but of course they tracked production. It was fun to compare, and interesting in that all of the ER docs had almost identical production. But then…they changed it so that we couldn’t see our production. \\nDown the line when they switched to base plus percentage, it became an issue.|Agree. #1 most important thing is that I can practice good, thorough medicine. Not possible with 15 min appointments.|The doctor asked me to put meds in a bag of fluids and I just stuck the needle through the side of the bag....|I’ve done that🤣|We had wall to wall stall mats. About every 2-3 months (as a tech at the time) I would pull them out and clean under them/disinfect both sides. Huge pain in the ass but it was econimical and worked. As a DVM I worked at the same clinic and was fine with the floors. In the stalls we had regular stall mats and they were sealed with a rubber caulk material (I had to reseal them once when I teched there). The other equine clinic I worked at had the same thing but in the year I worked there I never saw anyone pull them and clean underneath...god only knows what was growing under there. \\n\\nI have also seen the I would assume spray on grippy rubber stuff at the vet school but I don\\'t know cost wise what that would be.

They make a base $55k (if they are lucky) and our hospital just increases their production to 9%. They\\'re also all salaried so even if they pull a 100 hour week (which all my vets do!) They\\'re still only making 40 hour week pay. Our new grads are currently making $15/hr. It\\'s not work ethic that is going down. It\\'s businesses deciding vets shouldn\\'t be paid what they\\'re worth.|One of my veterinarians just had a very bad accident and needed multiple surgeries and was out for 2 months. When she got back the first thing our hospital said was \"you owe us $7500 for lost business, we\\'re taking it from your check\"\\n\\n She had to back out of an apartment that she was moving into because she couldn\\'t afford it now. She\\'s legitimately thinking of quitting the vet industry and working as a waitress because she \"made way more money with less stress\"|My friend just moved out of Texas because of the current political climate and said she would never go back, so not really gonna believe a stranger on the internet who can\\'t spell correctly. I also have relatives in Texas who are actively searching for a new place so they can move away as well.

And I\\'m (as well as many others are) not willing to move there on the chance that politicians there decide suddenly to become human beings with souls.|Apologies but I don\\'t feel comfortable saying where I live on the internet, but all hospitals in my state are roughly the same.|I work for a large emergency hospital. It sees small and large animals alike and we see wildlife as well. We have a doctor shortage because the company doesn\\'t want to pay us what we\\'re worth. We have doctors leaving vet med all together because they don\\'t want to pay us what we\\'re worth.|I am not a vet and I make more than our new vets do. I still don\\'t make much, but it\\'s more than them. And I will say that I live in an insanely high COL area. A studio apartment where I\\'m from can easily be $3k a month.|You have no clue what you\\'re talking about, my guy. They\\'re trying to find places that will pay them what they\\'re worth. Idk where you live but where I am that\\'s just not the case. I need you to open your eyes and see that not everyone lives in the same area you do and many people can\\'t afford to move across the country for a better paying job because they can barely afford to live where they are currently. \\n\\nMy doctors love being veterinarians. They are not leaving out of ignorance, they\\'re leaving because they cannot afford to live and pay off their loans with what is being offered. Or they\\'re offing themselves but that\\'s also tied into not being appreciated and paid what they\\'re worth. My doctors stay at the hospital for days at a time, sleeping/showering/eating here to care for their patients. They get paid their 40 hours a week but are here 100 hours a week, they\\'re not clocking out at 4pm, which you so condescendingly have decided they must be. Get off your high horse, my god|Thank you so much! It’s actually heartbreaking but I’ll try to find a way through it!|They say I had an obligation too as under the university guidelines. The support services wrote a letter to tell them what had happened and they said because of my OT assessment in early July that means none of that applies and I should have been able to study. Yeah because mental health is THAT stable. I don’t think there’s any winning with them. I brought up the equality act on my appeal because my ot officer said I would likely be covered under it. But they don’t care|Do you know if this counts for long term mental illness eg anorexia and diagnosed anxiety depression? x|I’m in the U.K. The OT report says its covered under the equality act. It’s a long term thing. But I didn’t want to take medical Leave because I thought it would be resolved within 2 weeks.|Going forward, make a point to tell clients, in front of your techs, the potential complications of not restricting activity - like hematomas. Quote some stats of how frequently this occurs if the dog is not strictly exercise restricted after surgery.  It might be a bit passive-aggressive, but it’s one way of showing them it was not your fault. It’s a way of teaching the techs that 1) you do have the knowledge and 2) your tech might be more at fault for allowing too much activity too soon.\\nI often use my conversations with clients as an indirect way to teach my techs. I come from a ER/ICU background, and I do many things differently (and more “purist”) than the other docs at the GP where I work.|These happen from activity.

This makes me a bit more sure of what im doing!|Have you tried a prep program?|Hey there... Well its not impossible but it\\'ll require some extra effort if ur looking  to do navle without vet prep... I personally studied initially by making my own notes from a no of sources.. i followed the list of diseases given by ICVA.. after 3 months of doing that i started preparing using Vetprep... since i practiced in a clinic aswell.. the clinical experience also helped.. but i could answer about 80% of those vetprep questions easily i could say.... So you can study for navle  without vetprep but its difficult.. and will require more time... and then there is a chance of not passing navle on the first try... so paying for vetprep is better than paying navle twice... I hope this helps..\\n Incase if youd need any help in ur preparation you can hit me up...|Kuru sneakers and compression socks.

For the lunging dogs, nope.|Was working about 60 hrs/week in ER/ICU when I decided it was now or never. I was CRAZY into my job, loved the intensity, the level of medicine, the focus on learning, and the great team I was a part of. But I was 33, knew I wanted more than one kid, and didn’t want to have kids when I was over forty. \\nAnd so it began - the shift from a full throttle ER/ICU vet, to a full throttle mom of five fantastic kids whom I ended up homeschooling for 9 years (7 years before Covid hit.). \\nIt began with a miscarriage during an overnight shift - fun times - then five babies in a span of 5.5 years (no twins.)\\nI went back to work after 3 months for the first and second, but worked weird hours (like 6 hour shifts) so that I would spend most of the days with them. After my fifth, I took a year off. \\nMy two oldest kids, now 21 and 20, were reminiscing recently about how sad they used to be when I went to work, because they felt like they wouldn’t see me again forever. \\nOne day I came home and found my oldest kid, about 7 at the time, missing an eyebrow. Dad - apparently my sixth child- had bet him $22 that he wouldn’t shave off an eyebrow. He did. Every time I worked, it seemed, stuff would happen.\\nOne day I was just leaning in to intubate an unconscious, cyanotic Pomeranian when I was paged. My husband was calling from the back of an ambulance, on the way to the hospital with my son who was gushing blood out his ear. (Backstory: Apparently he and his brother had been pretending to be dinosaurs by putting Q-tips in their ears, and jumping on the bed. Little guy fell on the bed, on the Q-tip, and of course it ruptured his ear drum and had to be surgically repaired with a graft. But I digress.)\\nAnyway, while leaning over that blue dog, chanting to my panicking self, “First save the dog. You can’t change the ambulance situation” was the moment I realized I just had to be home. \\nI took several years off except for a rare relief shift. When I started back, I had lost 99% of my confidence. It was awful and it was terrifying.\\nI’m 100% glad I was home with my kids while they were young but it’s almost a miracle that I had the guts to return.\\nIf I had it to do over, I guess I would have made it a point to do like one shift a month.\\nI started back by doing some vaccine clinics (shhh), then GP relief, then back to ER.  When my youngest got to high school age, I took on more shifts, but I still usually work shorter shifts (9-4, 4-11) because I want to be around for them. I do relief only so that I can schedule work around every one of their hockey games and saxophone performances. I refuse to miss ANYthing they do!\\nMy focus is 100% my kids. No longer my career. Don’t get me wrong - I’m super diligent and thorough with work when I work - but I work because it’s what I do with my time when my kids don’t need me. \\nHaving a baby will change your career, but there is nothing wrong with that. It doesn’t make it worse, just different. \\nGood luck!|I wrote a long reply to OP, but want to share my experience with you. I had 5 kids in 5.5 years, and never went back full time. I was (and am) all-in as a parent.\\nMy one regret is that I ended up taking a few years off while I was homeschooling four of my five (long before covid.)  Those homeschooling years were the absolute BEST, but to return to practice after that was terrifying because I had lost all confidence in my ability. If you do take time away, consider doing a relief shift once a month or so, just to keep that door open.|I hear ya on all that!  I would not mind if something I was passionate about that paid well landed in my lap! But I will say, being able to do relief work so that I can choose exactly when I want to work (“I can come in from 9-12, will that be helpful?”) has been a godsend. I am able to work enough to pay for everything they need, but still be around for them. \\nHaving kids close in age is awesome. Really really hard when they are little, but so much fun once they can all pee in the potty and buckle their own seatbelts!|Vegan pet food?

I am excited about this project too. I am happy to see their [collaboration with Storj](https://mysterium.network/blog/mysterium-and-storj-labs-join-forces/). I am still reviewing their whitepaper and comparing it to the Orchid Protocol. If any one has any cliff's notes I'd appreciate it :). I am interested in using VPNs for increased DAPP security (DDoS attacks). ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/mrg7bb/just_bought_my_first_myst_tokens_and_feel/guo6ytu/ | My first observation is that Mysterium highlights the intention of splitting up packets to traverse different paths along the VPN network which protects a user from a malicious node. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/mrg7bb/just_bought_my_first_myst_tokens_and_feel/guy06xo/ | You can buy on Polygon using Quickswap if you can cheaply get funds onto Polygon. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/n4omws/buying_mysterium_crypto/gwx8g85/\n",

      "Wow so i fixed it guys. I deleted the DNS in my Wi-Fi settings and after a new one was generated I hit apply. Then all of the sudden I was back online! My question is what in the world caused that to happen? I love Mysterium but feel very sketched out, yet idk if it was even their fault. What do you guys think? I’m skeptical of reinstalling it again. I had a some MYST in my account prior to uninstalling, I doubt I would get it back if I reinstalled right? Not the end of the world, I’m just happy to be online again although I missed a lot of meetings this morning. Really curious how this happened after enabling the kill switch, quitting and uninstalling. Lmk what you think. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xx6kgk/need_help_ever_since_i_enabled_kill_switch_i_cant/iraks5t/ | Feels like I’ve won the lottery.

Now I'm really not touching this project. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/twpgt1/psa_moderators_are_censoring_posts_on/i3kenty/ | Okay good to know, I jumped on a Russian node and started thinking twice lol. You think it’s safer going with residential nodes or no difference? 🥂 ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tsbqed/security/i2wtq00/ | YES. Any more of a liability compared to something like ExpressVPN or any other popular centralized vpn? Given the nature of both i feel like it would be more prevalent with dVPNs but really don’t know ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tsbqed/security/i2wu0ju/ | Wow! Yeah seems the returns with Mysterium aren't great, I would have to enable whitelisting as well. Helium is a cool project. I wanted to buy a miner and antenna but all of the miners were sold out with a 6 month waiting period. I talked to this guy who does free installs but takes like 80% of the rewards which seemed pointless. Monero mining I don't know anything about. I don't have a mining rig either, just an iMac but I have no issue buying the equipment if the returns are steady ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tijvgl/best_ways_to_earn_supplemental_income_aside_from/i1ervof/ |  Yeah I think I am. Do you have any tips? I would be considered a noob but have good internet speeds and hardware. What kind of returns do you get? What are your thoughts on enabling whitelisting? Is it worthy the drop in MYST? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/thwllq/mysterium_vs_orchid/i1cbhz0/ | Lol fair enough. Hows the returns with presearch? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/thwllq/mysterium_vs_orchid/i1cvidl/ | Yeah it's bad. What's up with that? I hope they're at least working on something. They have no presence at all it's creepy. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/thwllq/mysterium_vs_orchid/i2nxv92/ | What type of returns do you see?

Why would they do it if there aren't any benefits? Most people likely won't care if an app rating is a bit less than 5. Not like Mysterium gets money from reviews (unless something on google play does that?), and the chances of someone seeing the reviews and seeing all of \"Thanks\" and deciding to get the app and buy stuff is rare. They would likely see the bots and decide to leave, which brings me to my next point. If another company rating botted Mysterium with five stars, it could seem untrustworthy to people (such as yourself), and then people would not use the application and try spreading that it's deceitful. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/z5za2w/lets_talk_about_how_90_of_the_android_app_google/iyakv1m/ | Also, if Mysterium's app rating inflated by a worker, Mysterium could get more sales, get more profit, and in turn salary's may be increased.

If you look at reviews on play store, the trending reviews are currently 1 star and 5 star, which could intrigue people to look further.

Looking through the \"see all reviews\" though, I scrolled a bit and didn't see a single \"Thank\" review. If you read the rest of my comment, it would also show similar to this, so I am hoping you actually read this comment this time.

Then there are some species, and some animals with physical limits, that require some \"creative\" techniques and positions.

They are a DVM but would you like your clients and nurses asking them for advice or diagnoses or orders in your clinic during a visit just because they have a DVM degree? | Your doctoral degree gives you access to the title in daily life but PhDs generally dont go around referring to themselves as Dr xyz in hospitals or clinics, except for the super self-important, because in that context doctor is assumed to refer to physician, MD or in our case veterinarian. Yes, when you get the degree you are a \"doctor\", but you're not able to take on the job of \"doctor\" in clinic until you hold a medical license. You can't give nurses med orders, you can't legally make diagnoses, you can't discuss prognosis or counsel owners, etc until you have the appropriate license to do so. Thus the title Dr. and the degree DVM mean slightly different things. There are DVMs who don't hold medical licenses that actually shouldn't be called doctor in clinic for example, as that is confusing to others, as much as y'all think it's devaluing to the degree. | But you have a license somewhere, which means something.

It has nothing to do with whether you've completed \"doctorate level coursework\" or not. It's got to do with whether you've qualified for a medical license by completing an AVMA accredited course. DVM is just a fancy flourish of letters to increase Americans sense of self-importance. It's an accomplishment to get one obviously, but it doesn't qualify you to practice the job of being a doctor.

DPT physiotherapist?\n",
      "\n",
      "what about MVBs, or BVetMeds? do they not get to call themselves doctor? there's no doctor in their veterinary degree title. RVTs who also have a research doctorate? do they get to introduce themselves as Dr. soandso to owners?\n",

      "your ability to fulfill a ROLE or JOB in a hospital is what makes you a doctor to the general public, not your degree title. youre conflating honorary titles of doctor in the social domain with the job of doctor in a hospital when they are separate things.\n",
      "\n",
      "yes obviously licensure in one state does not automatically hold bearing in any other state. once you have obtained the general substrates for a license (a veterinary degree, NAVLE completion in north america) you can complete locally specific substrates and apply for licenses with ease. in that sense, having a license in one place makes you roughly eligible to apply for licensure in another, especially when other boards request letters of good standing etc. | You're allowed to hate it. I couldn't possibly take myself so seriously. I suppose if you're working hard people will always recognize that before what's embroidered on your coat. | Correct, that's my entire point. A doctor can be a social title or it can be a job but for some people it's not both. For vets and MDs we are called doctor in the hospital because of our medical license rather than our doctoral degree.\n",
      "To be even more confusing, nurses can have research phds or DNPs which often qualify them as nurse practicioners. | Depends how hard you work in RVT school. I'd be willing to bet if a dedicated and focused student did a bachelor's program in vet technology, they could make their life a hell of a lot easier in vet school. | Your ability to do well in an MMI has very little to do with your ability to speak with clients. | If you think it's condescending to acknowledge someone's feelings the class is absolutely targeted specifically at you. | Who cares about how respected a degree is? If that's your rationale for getting one or the other and you hate the job in the end, you're going to have wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars. You should get the degree that allows you to do the work you want to do because YOU respect it, not because other people do | Everybody says they can't see themselves doing anything else but I find it's often simply because they don't actually know what jobs look like. You're attracted to this funny, inaccurate but idealized imagination of what being a vet is, but you should go and get some work experience in various fields to help you decide. | There's so much more to the challenges of this profession but that's a start. | So your first reason for regretting being in vet med is something you have total control over? Get a new job if you don't get along with your coworkers.\n",
      "Also letting people get under your skin gives them the greatest power over you. Get someone to help you manage difficult interactions. They literally don't have to ruin your day. | You sound salty. There is definitely a distinct advantage to having a solid knowledge base built on memorization of useful facts about medicine. Yes if you know how to problem solve and find information you can get there despite a weak knowledge base but having the memorization component gets you through the problem solving faster. Navle success obviously isn't the sole predictor of success as a vet but knowing things helps immensely instead of having to look them up constantly. | How else do you address a fundamental knowledge licensing exam to an entire profession with so many diverse end points? How else do you justify allowing vets to literally switch focuses at the drop of a hat? No, not every vet is going to be omniscient, but do you instead want to change licensing to be segregated by species? How do you ensure that vets have adequate training and knowledge to work with the species they about to operate on or prescribe meds to? I guarantee schools can't prepare us adequately and I do agree fundamentally that board licensing exams can be problematic, but there are some really questionable vets out there with licenses. What do you do instead? | specialization already exists. examples include surgery, anaesthesia, medicine, large animal medicine, oncology, opthalmology, general practice. we don't expect all vets to do all of these things expertly. i dont think you need to be omniscient or expert in all of these fields to pass the navle. you do have to have an understanding of vet med and be ready to enter any of these fields though. | I hope you don't talk to everybody in your life with so much derision. Obviously we aren't expected to be competent at everything after four years. Yes I agree that the standard of training in this profession is mediocre at times. I don't think it has to do with the navle | Grossed over 1mill as in you billed over 1mill for the practice? | Texas doesn't have an income tax does it? | I didn't become a vet because of a love of animals. Such an unfortunate cliche. | I think you should reflect on whether you actually feel hate for this person or whether it's something else that you're labelling as hate incorrectly. When we overuse the word hate to describe our feelings it probably makes us more negative. Better to stop and see if you're actually feeling resentment, insecurity, jealousy. Those are easier feelings to understand and move past than just hate. | You think vet med is far less important than software engineering? The science that much of our world today is built on? One of the most rapidly developing industries worldwide? I think you're confused. | typo, i meant to say far more important. my comment still stands. i think you vastly overestimate the importance of vets to your average individual. animal health care has always and will always take a back seat to many other things. if you wanted a \"fair\" salary as a \"doctor\" you should've gone to med school. having a doctoral degree means virtually nothing. people don't pay you millions of dollars just because your degree has the word doctor in it. | LOL you're funny | Then you must already understand that academic doctors don't have the same earning potential as medical doctors and it's essentially because of variability in demand for their distinct skill sets as well as the mechanisms through which procedural physicians bill for their services. Human health care is an inevitable expense so MDs will always have protected incomes. It's easy then to understand why vets will never be paid the same as human doctors, and if we were people would frankly just avoid seeking care for their animals | If you went into vet med just so people would have to call you doctor you chose the wrong profession. Vet med is a first entry degree in several countries, completed in 5-6 years of undergraduate work. Let's be honest, most people's undergrad was a four year lesson in how to study and be professional. Most people don't carry content forward from their undergrad which helps them practice medicine. | Vet med is absolutely doable if you are willing to develop your own interpersonal skills and resilience. There is definitely tons of abuse in the profession but if you can make it through whatever is thrown at you in vet school you start to set your own rules when you graduate. Once you're licensed you are absolutely in control and the field doesn't have to be a hell hole. It just tends to chew up people who don't develop their constitution on the way. | No unfortunately ethical teaching is mostly wasted on vets. | Because nobody actually follows the teaching, utilizes ethical frameworks, makes consistently balanced decisions, or acts in an ethical way. Tons of my classmates behave unethically all the time and they have it freshest in their minds. People just come to their knee jerk conclusion and defend why they consider their decision to be ethical. The righteous mind by Jonathan haidt provides some very good insight into this phenomenon. | a very gentle but incorrect attempt to analyze my perception. no, these are genuinely unethical decisions, its not a difference of ethical values. im fine with people having different personal ethics to me as long as there is no direct or indirect harm to others. my initial post was obviously hyperbole. many vets do ethical things. my criticism is that they often do it intuitively rather than rationally, and vet students can learn ethical frameworks but act hypocritically in spite of this, or fail to apply them to their own actions. | God that's horrific advice. I agree on sticking it out but definitely don't handle rotations like that | I'm struggling to remember anatomy and parasites as well, and I've been at the top of my class for three years. I wouldn't fuss too much, just do your best, get it done with and decide what you want to do once your life has settled down a bit. I'm not typically a sunk cost fallacy type of person but you've invested so much already and this degree opens so many doors for you, just do your best while maintaining your sanity. | 1/3 of vets and owners also think that placebo improves osteoarthritis so let's remember our cognitive biases in reassessing these animals. | Sedation | Dont get a MacBook, they charge literally hundreds to thousands more for the same components as a PC. You're literally just paying for the name. It makes zero sense as a student. | They hold their value because of their brand and consistency in structural manufacture. Sure there are PCs that degenerate quickly but there are tons of PC manufacturers that make machines which retain processing speed and structural integrity over equally long periods of time. PC is still far better value, especially for a student. | It's because you have poor teachers who aren't taking the time to correct your approach. | I'm not at Bristol but I'm also a mature Canadian who attends vet school in the UK and I've spoken to a Bristol student, it sounds like a well run program. | They make efforts to ensure the courses are all standardized but I would definitely have preferred Bristol or any other school over RVC | Most animal products and byproducts are associated with some degree of harm, death is probably the least deplorable form of animal suffering to be honest. I don't know why people fixate so much on animal slaughter when most of it is aimed to be done humanely. It's the other harms associated with farming that I find more shocking, like lameness, mastitis, untreated infection and nutritional disease. If we're going to use animals for food the absolute least we can do is provide them with solid quality of life while we have them alive. | Organic food is a marketing scam to begin with and yeah I'll bet it has serious welfare implications. I've not spent time on an organic farm and I probably won't ever as I don't intend to practice on farm animals but it's not surprising at all. | Best to pick a school that is avma accredited and teaches in your first language. Also be aware that UK schools and some other vet programs in English speaking countries do not award DVMs, but an equivalent typically at the bachelor's level. Lots of north American students at my school refer to themselves incorrectly as DVM students but if the label really matters to you then you should consider attending a north American school instead. | Sounds super passive aggressive and unnecessary. Imagine spending all that time trying to covertly convince other people that you're right and they're wrong instead of just directly addressing concerns as they come up. | I started at 29 and I'm far from the oldest in my class | Masters degrees do nothing for you as an Ontario applicant unless you are extremely productive in publishing. OVC is exceptionally difficult to get admitted to and not somewhere to hang your hat on. | Canadian schools are impractical for most students to apply to. | No Canadian bank will give you enough money on a student line of credit to attend international schools. | Nobody can get into in province schools. There are SO many students wanting to pursue the profession, enough to easily fix the vet shortage. They just can't get accepted in province. The system is actually completely broken. I got rejected from OVC three cycles in a row, now I just don't feel motivated to return after having to go internationally for my education. Ontario would have to pay me the difference in my tuition for me to return home at this point. Instead OVC has created 20 rural seats with Lakehead for students to try and lie their way into just to get admitted. | Nobody posting on Reddit asking about international vet schools can get into Canadian schools. | You need to apply for AVMA accredited schools to write the navle and work in Canada. Eaeve accreditation doesnt qualify you for a Canadian license as far as I know, without doing lots of additional, expensive licensing exams | OVC won't even interview students with less than a 90% average these days, despite their grade cutoff being 75%. The admissions process is a black box and we have no way to get help with improving our odds of admission, the school refuses to discuss these things. Students also seem to have a distinct advantage having gone to Guelph so in my experience if you went to any other university the odds were stacked against you. | Yep, I'm just saying the federal and provincial loans are not even close to enough to be able to pay tuition let alone afford the education. You essentially need to have wealthy parents to attend international vet school. | this is absolutely true, i know many of them from my vet program, but they are typically not canadians. the reality is that most canadian vet med applicants know of nothing outside of their provincial program. they all try really hard to get in and some don't even learn about international schools until their first or second rejection. the only students going to these international schools right away without a thought are the ones with independently wealthy parents with connections. most students who end up going internationally have tried in province several times already and are only going as a last resort. | OVC may not specifically select for guelph students but there is a guelph advantage in being in close proximity to the FVC, getting advice from vet student friends, having easy access to the limited feedback the school offers. i applied for years to OVC, got rejected with no explanation every year. strong candidate on paper, fantastic references from vets, human medical professionals, so much support from all of my colleagues, extracurriculars and strong work experiences. ill never know what they wanted me to say or not say, or what i got rejected for. all i know is i wasted three years of my life waiting for that school when i could be in internships right now. i am nothing special, and there are many extremely competent students in the exact same position that i was in, some of them are my classmates now. | No it won't as long as the school is AVMA accredited and you satisfy the other qualities and qualifications these programs are looking for. Just for your info if you're planning to attend school in the UK and it's even within the realm of possibility that you might want to pursue training here, UK internships won't even generally consider vets without 1-2+ years of GP experience. | Pay in the UK is extremely poor for new grads compared to Canada and the US. I would go elsewhere if I were you. Stay in north America if possible. | Sounds shady AF. | Work on your interpersonal skills and bring it up with management. It's not your place to manage this person, you're only responsible for your own reactions and responses to rudeness. | Sounds like toxic management. If this is an ongoing thing they need to be involved. Trying direct interpersonal management yourself is fine for the first time or two but it's not your job to discipline other employees. I personally would be telling my management I'll be finding a better workplace if it's really intolerable. That's not on you at all. | Probably not every program has a policy like that but it doesn't sound totally unreasonable. You need to be competent in many disciplines as a vet. | Your legs will adapt to the standing but it's an active job and will tire you out most days anyway. Try to make sure you aren't just standing still, if you dont need to be perfectly still try to shift your weight between your feet and push up on your tip toes periodically to prevent blood stasis through muscle pump action. | Grades definitely matter to some extent but they're not the sole determinant of the quality of your practice. You have all your life to refine your knowledge and some people are poor test takers. You definitely have to have an understanding of the material to potentially score well on tests but you don't have to score well on tests to necessarily have a strong understanding of the material.\n",
      "The other option to consider is that you're actually overestimating your understanding of the content. Test results aren't everything but they do tell you something about what you know. | I loved anatomy, physiology and pharmacology in my undergrad and wanted to be an MD but didn't want to go through all the silly games and hoop jumping to be given the opportunity to apply. Vet med was more attainable. | I definitely think you'd struggle to say there's no correlation at all. It's not the only determining factor but vets that have a broader knowledge base definitely have the potential to be better vets | Correct, read my other post. There is still a correlation, because you have to know things to be a vet at all and really good vets know a lot of things. Obviously there are outliers when it comes to test performance but you can't say there's NO correlation, just that it's not a perfect correlation. | Yeah the system is definitely broken. Vet admissions are such a horrific gameshow of just making yourself fit into a perfect little box.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it makes you feel any better, I got into a UK vet school and it's intensely underwhelming to me anyway. Would've definitely rather stayed in Canada or the US. I've been trying to transfer since I started. | That's because RVC already admits far more students than they have the resources to support. The graduating class is the largest in the world by a long shot. | It's aberystwyth students not Harper Keele, but you're right. It's overpopulated and they just keep stuffing more and more students into a single year. I can't stand it | I can't wait to get out. Feels like such a waste of my money. | If you're training in the UK this is expected. In the US or Canada, almost frowned on but not at all impossible | Wish I knew before coming here to study. I'm absolutely not waiting to see gp before an internship. I'm too old for that. Guess I'll have to go back to north America again before returning to the UK. | Don't become a vet if it's only because you love animals. Volunteer at a shelter or rescue if that's what you want. Become a vet because you find medicine fascinating and love helping people solve problems. | The only way to remedy that is to practice and ask for graded (incremental) opportunities. | You can definitely teach empathy, it's a skill just like any other. What you can't do is make someone with shitty behavior realize they are they issue, they have to figure that one out. | Probably to states with better protection of women's healthcare rights and access, seeing as how so much of our workforce is women\n"

      "I think your position is not an uncommon one. I've seen it many times in real life and seen it on this subreddit even more. I've been working in vet med for 15 years and have worked every position in the hospital at some point. I currently offer my relief services to 5 hospitals and have worked at nearly 20 in my time ranging from small single doctor GP clinics to university ECC. All this to say that, in my experience, this happens to even boarded specialists at any and all levels.\n",

      " I've worked with brilliant technicians who I would trust over some doctors and whose advice is absolutely golden.

You will make mistakes and they will help you catch them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, a substantial amount of the techs/assistants you're working with will not be these people. A large amount of the work force for nurses are on the job trained and have only worked at maybe 1-2 hospitals for a few years. They don't know what they don't know, and I can say this because I went through that gauntlet myself. The more I've learned the quicker I am to pause and think about why someone may have done something they did. There's a good chance the people giving you trouble are the ones who fall in this category. It boils my blood to see how pervasive it is to have nurses who don't even understand why decisions are being made criticize doctors for them. There are multiple boarded specialists I've seen get shit on by nurses who when pressed for more details about exactly what they did wrong could either only provide wrong information, are lacking SIGNIFICANT context clues or base knowledge to even understand what they're judging, or just don't have anything worth while and just like the drama. The people who lack this knowledge are the quickest to judge and those who know the most tend to be more patient and understanding. This has been true for pretty much every single one of my 18 clinics I've worked at. \n",

If it's from the clinic drama queen with the over inflated ego then just ignore it and move on. You have too many more important things to do than pay those type of people even a minute of your day | Unless youre refusing on calls (which is only a very small percentage of surgeons) then expect to work \\~40-50 hours completely excluding your on-call time. Its what made me stop pursuing surgery as a specialty. I looked around at every surgeon at all the hospitals I worked at and realized not a single one had a work/life balance I would be happy with | Very classic case of them thinking they know way more than they do. They quite literally don't know enough to even differentiate what makes a good vs bad vet. You have a toxic coworker problem not a you problem | Depends on what your definition of worth it is. It's a large investment upfront and requires the ability to constantly be learning and growing. There's a ton of responsibility and half your job is basically client communication. Being a good doctor is only half the job because of this unfortunate fact. Debt load is high but so can the salaries be. I do relief, can make anywhere from 200-400k depending how hard I want to work, set my own hours, get to do something I love and live exactly the type of life I want. For me it's absolutely worth it but for many people it's absolutely not. If I had to do GP I'd absolutely quit and change fields. As with anything it's a bit what you make of it | I work in SoFlo. The work isn't as reliable as COVID times but for me it's still there. Location dependent for sure. I tend to work at 24h specialty centers and most of them I just called in and asked to be put in contact with whoever could tell me if they needed any additional relief assistance. Pretty much everyone has been happy to talk | I get it on my own! I'm child free and in good health so it's only like $360 for me so would be pretty minimal savings if I signed on somewhere compared to the freedom and tax deductions having an S-Corp allows me | Definitely one perk of being in my situation.

Unfortunately I'm not sure what insurance they have though. I did briefly get into negotiations with them but ended up staying on my own | I dont necessarily think you need an internship with your level of experience but definitely need to be working at a place with good mentorship for a while. I wouldnt be rushing into overnights alone, for instance. You likely could handle the majority of things but things can get complicated quickly in ER and not having to have someone to bounce something off of \"hey this sounds reasonable right?\" can put a big burden on you if youre not prepared for it | Sounds like youre working at an absolute dumpster fire of a hospital. Get out ASAP and completely forget anything those garbage vets taught you. You can make it friend there are definitely better hospital (probably >90-95% of them) out there | Same in SoFlo\n"

      "x. Rotating internship first, choose one that has at least 2 board certified radiologists (need at least two letters of rec from them)\n",
      "x. if you didn't get published in vet school, you need to do it during the rotating internship\n",
      "x. Read Thrall on your downtime\n",
      "\n",
      "Post Rotating Internship:\n",
      "x. Apply for both specialty radiology imaging internships (1yr) and residencies (3-4yrs) in the same Match cycle; if you don't match to a residency first try (quite rare), hopefully you'll match to an imaging internship. Get published during this internship if you did not in the previous two steps. Read the entirety of Thrall during this internship.\n",
      "\n",
      "x. Many many people get stuck after rotating and are unable to secure a residency position; its very competitive. It's a mix of good preparation (high GPA, good letters of rec, publications), personality (gotta get along with people for three years in residency so they won't choose an asshole no matter how brilliant you are), and connections (see step 1, getting to know the radiology department at your vet school). Above all, a healthy does of luck.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why do all of this? Radiology is AWESOME.

NO owner communication - never get yelled at or make another estimate ever again. Work life balance - arguably the best you'll ever have in this field, you can work from home 100% of the time if you want to, but also amazing flexibility (can work part time from home, part in specialty hospital for example, or go do ultrasounds in local clinics one day a week). Money - you'll be nice and comfy. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you have the financial means and the time to put your head down and grind through the internships to get a residency... I say give it a shot. Hit me up with questions if you have them! | Most of the doctors working at vet schools have to also be doing research in addition to their clinical and teaching duties.

      "Yeah, my biggest critique of a lot of these hospitals is a lack of teaching hospitals. My school has interns, residents, 4th years, 3rd years, and students from the Caribbean schools without a teaching hospital. We barely have the case load and staff to adequately teach these students. Adding more students in classes does nothing to remedy the need for more places to practice and hone clinical skills such as S/N, diagnosis, client communication, etc, etc, etc. Many of these schools have no plans to build a clinical hospital alongside. So their students will be sent in to hospitals that may not be able to adequately teach them. | I would go for cheapest. I went to a tiny state school for undergraduate, was one of the top picks for my first choice school and my friend got into Cornell. You can save money, and use your time wisely to get involved in extracurriculars, research, and veterinary experience that will help you stand out a lot more than a prestigious school. | Leptospirosis (urine) and rabies (saliva) are the big ones. Bites can cause bacterial infections. | I mean, if you have a passion for shelters, there is a ton of work you can do to take the management, advocacy, and organization off the vets to make a big impact. Oftentimes, it's not just lack of vets or techs willing to do this work, it's lack of supplies, money, and organization power. I've worked with vets who can spay a dog every ten minutes. If they had access to an environment to help them, they could make a huge impact. But they're hindered by the legalities of operating, using controlled drugs, etc. | Yes! I loved sending new owners home with a magnet of our local ER. My parents still have one, and it was very useful when my dog's eye started bleeding and they panicked. | If you've finished the prerequisite classes, yes. You'll have to look at the schools you're interested in to see their requirements. | The Vet at Noah's Ark was so good to me! | I would say, because I'm sure grades and everything will be available on transcripts. On the write in section, just explain your dismissal and the academic steps you've taken since, as well as experience gained. | My advisor recommended I break them down into research and veterinary experience to help create a diverse portfolio. | Oof, that's rough. If she's consistently not getting asked to interview, she's not likely getting culled in a strict GPA cut-off or there is something in her written work of her application that is getting her ruled out. Without feedback, it's hard to say why. | It has to do with what the national board requires. I'd recommend looking at the specific residency you're interested in requires to get a clear answer. Internships are typically required and may help with being competitive, but are not required for every specialty.\n",

Does that make sense? | Nitpicking and even told me I was using an instrument incorrectly and broke it, when this was absolutely not true. It was some other issue that caused the malfunction, which we later discovered | I’m either getting emotional support or being attacked for no apparent reason by people who COMPLETELY misunderstood my point and now deemed me arrogant and a horrible person lol | Appreciate you | I appreciate this sentiment but this is also misinterpreting my specific post. I don’t know if I just worded this horribly but no one understands my point 🥹 | Thanks for the encouragement 💗 | Again you’re misunderstanding what I’m saying. I have no arrogance and am a very humble down to earth person, but this tech chose to only call me my first name, not the other doctors, which to me is a sign of disrespect…I don’t require her to call me doctor, but it would be nice for me to given the opportunity to say hey it’s fine to call me ___ | Just to clarify. I don’t see them as below me. I don’t see anyone as below me. | I love learning from techs and I have no problem putting my title aside and learning from someone super experienced. However, I don’t appreciate when they treat me like an idiot. That’s what irritates me | Again, see my other replies. Not about ego | I am concerned bc if there is disrespect amongst staff, there is a weak link. I care most about patient care, and that care will be best if the staff is respectful to each other and trusting of each person’s expertise they bring to the table.\n",
      "I won’t take your veiled passive aggression personally. | lol the amount of veiled passive aggression is cracking me up. I did not mean to start fights people 😂 | Yeah that makes perfect sense | Oh yes thank you for noticing lol yeah not sure why I’m being personally attacked but oh well 🥹 appreciate your comment | I am younger by a few years but I’m not sure why age has any correlation with respect. Good question though | Agreed 100% | You can think what you want, but I replied to several comments and explained what I meant because it was a miscommunication. Please see those comments. It’s funny to me that people are saying it’s about ego, when it’s the opposite. It’s about imposter syndrome that I am currently in therapy for to overcome. | Yes it’s not a typical internship for sure. It’s their own kind of mentorship program.

And no it’s not B/S, I saw them do this with another young vet here. And yes it’s a 2 hour lunch daily. I know it sounds too good to be true | Yeah this is how I feel…like im willing to be paid less and not hate my life as a new doctor | No it’s a small private clinic | What’s bad about this internship compared to a rotating “real” one though? I’m still getting trained by DVMs, and they’re all GP so it’s exactly the cases I would be seeing. And I’m getting paid higher too | They don’t pay based on production | I could easily find a splenic mass— I feel pretty confident in my US skills, rads are okkkk though 😅 but we have tools to help with rads. I see what you’re saying but I feel like it’s hard to lump all grads into one category bc the truth is every person has a diff level of experience. \n",

I’m working 12 hour days and not even getting a penny.. it feels wrong. And I’m 28 , a doctor, with no money to my name. | This is amazing info, thank you!!! | Wow good for you!! Luckily, I have been able to do surgeries every week so I’m feeling very confident with surgery. Medicine though is a wholeeee other ballgame for me 🤣😅 | This is so helpful, thank you so much!! | Wow this was so thorough, thank you so much! How did you approach brushing up on these topics? Notes, or any specific sources? | Wow you’re amazing, thank you so much for this answer!! I fortunately will start out with a whopping 60 minute appointment slot 👍🏼 | What specifically is giving you a difficult time? | There were a handful of late career changers in my vet class. If 4+ years of little sleep and constant studying is worth it to you, then it’s worth it. If you have any doubts about that, I would advise against. | I got in with a 3.3 GPA from a top 10 undergrad school as a biology major | Out of state, I applied in 2018. With this gpa and 550 hours of experience I got interviewed by 3 schools and into all 3 on my first try | Yes this is a very important point you made, thank you for this comment | Yeah I thought about this. I would love to end up at this hospital though for other reasons. But yes, definitely an option | This sounds really interesting and applicable. Thank you | Telling what? I included that detail bc I am also female and I’m not sure if it’s a female jealousy situation which is not uncommon in the workplace | I’m not sure why people are getting pressed by my usage of the term females. I was just specifying it’s not males, just females. Or “women,” not sure why this matters? | Yes thank you for explaining that. It’s about not trusting me | I’m sorry you dealt with this too. I am also very shy and quiet /unassuming. \n",
      "I will check out that Facebook group, thanks for the recommendation. | Thank you for perfectly explaining that.

Not sure why you’d assume I treat people poorly based on one word | What am I implying? Genuinely confused. I am a female and don’t find this word offensive in any way | That’s actually the book series that made me want to be a vet haha. Read the whole series in 6th grade | Would you be open to saying which corporate did that? | What makes it routine/boring? Like just ear issues and allergies? | Haha are you a new grad? | What does mentoring look like? I just ask questions if I need to in real time? Like how does that look for the client? Haha if that makes sense | Interesting!! I’ve worked with Banfield but not VCA. Would you say it’s been a positive experience overall? | Oh so basically like vet school! That sounds so nice. I would love that | Have you ever worked with Banfield? I’m just curious bc I know Banfield has a pretty bad rep for giving wayyy too heavy of case loads.

      "Also what is mars kool aid? Lol | Thank you for the thorough reply. I don’t think I’ll be that disturbed by what I see…I am mentally prepared for that. The limited funds is a good point. How many surgeries do you do in a day? I’ve heard some crazy numbers like 80 per day…? | What’s the low pay? I’ve seen google say it’s like 100k?? Idk if that’s accurate though | So there’s no room for growth either? Just stays 100k forever? | Thanks for the info 🙏🏻 | One thing that really helped me is looking up consensus statements on google about various diseases. Know the diseases deeply, not just surface level. Understand the physiology behind diseases—this deeper understanding makes all the difference. This made me raise my score 100 points and I passed with ease. | I would love to hear more about your experiences!! | I have SEVERE anxiety and dissociation and I also debated asking for double time, as anxiety truly is a disability during tests. However, I ultimately decided to not do that (for my 2nd attempt) and I’m SO GLAD I didn’t!!! Two days of the test is even more stressful than one day imo. Go with your gut. My gut told me to not ask for more time and it paid off for me. | I was 2 questions away from passing my first attempt and I literally wanted to drop out I was so depressed. Everyone around was celebrating—i lived with two girls who passed. It was living hell. My best advice is to not think about it at all. I started going on long runs and watching good movies. I didn’t retake it until after graduation when I was refreshed. Your mind can do crazy things telling you that you’ll never pass, what if what if what if. Think about your accomplishments of getting this far and trust that your story will be perfect in the end. | MDs have 3 exams and a residency and vets have 1 exam and no residency required. That’s all I needed to know. Lol. | Yeah it’s an unfortunate situation. I wish hazing didn’t exist but it is alive and well. I will not go to management bc I’d rather just suffer in silence than cause a confrontation | I understand how it can be annoying to see someone you feel more experienced than, making more money than you. Quite honestly, most techs I know could easily be doctors if they had the means to. So I get it. It’s just a tough situation all around. | Thanks for this thorough response! \n",
      "I absolutely agree that learning from seasoned techs is crucial, and I have been doing that (although it is tricky terrain bc while I want to learn as much as I can, it is also scary to be vulnerable and risk the techs thinking I don’t know anything…regardless, I have continued to ask questions). \n",
      "I’m sorry you lost a patient due to a dvm’s unwillingness to accept your help, that’s quite sad and unacceptable. \n",
      "I also tend to second guess myself but I always refer to the books and make sure what I’m saying is accurate. Honestly half the battle is just having confidence. I tend to know the answers but I doubt myself and people can feel that I’m sure | I am definitely not assertive lol so yes agreed | It’s disappointing that other women are dealing with the same treatment. I am indeed a woman. Sorry for you too, being the support system to us vets is not easy. | Haha well at least someone thinks that. We weren’t even recognized by Peloton as “real doctors” for a while lol | True that. And 100% yeah being a PCP is difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I won’t lie, it wasn’t an easy experience 😅 that boards exam was rough bc it covered everything and every species. | Half are licensed half are not. Well you seem really kind.

It is administered by exam centers that also proctor exams for other major tests and you can't bring anything into the room with you. | Go to whichever school will leave you with the least amount of debt when done. | You will need to understand stats concepts for vet school such as positive and negative predictive value and standard deviations.  You will also need to be able to do basic drug calculations.    Undergraduate math courses are more advanced than anything you will have to do in vet school, but you are expected to have retained a baseline knowledge of concepts. Your college grades will help determine if you're a candidate for vet school application. Vet schools will want to see that you've already found ways to manage areas you struggle in academically by the time you've applied.  They may not care if you failed 9th grade math, but they will care if you failed a second year stats course. | 4th year sucks, but there are so many aspects of vet med that can be explored later on.  You have 3? months left of rotations.  Finish it, then take some time off to figure out what to do with your degree. | Meal prep is the answer I need to also follow more frequently.

Getting those reps in will help you build confidence in each topic and plan out a speel.. and it's always fine to say \"hey I don't know, I'll find out\" and go read some journals and find your answer.. like for the weird dog respiratory disease, I had a bunch of clients that I sent an email to once I had a chance to read up from trusted sources.

      "Also adding through a vaccutainer can be problematic because that vacuum is calibrated to the ideal draw volume for the tube and if you lose the vacuum, you're then guesstimating the right ratio, although depending on what/why you're testing that can be more or less problematic.

If you work with a vet then its veterinary and that looks a little better just cause its exposure to the industry (and the application is proving you know what its like). Animal experience is any work with animals with no vet present, this still looks great on an application but if you had to choose then do veterinary | Surplus of vets is kind of a stretch. Maybe surplus of GP in certain areas but, we are definitely lacking in other areas. One big factor is location. There are no vet schools in a lot of states and that means there are generally less vets going to those states. For example the dakotas, nevada, new mexico, wyoming, etc. dont have vet schools so the only people moving to those states to be vets are people who left them for vet school originally. Adding schools to those states would help those local areas retain vets and help the states as a whole. Where my family is from in NYC there is a couple week waiting time for most clinics in the area so I would argue that there is still a need for more clinics. In addition more and more people don’t want to use corporations and seek out mom and pop vet services. | Peabody DVM on youtube and the university of minnesota wet lab videos are grest for anatomy! | I also heard vet prep itself isnt covered by federal loans so if you have to get private loans just for the pre program then its not worth it | What i’m saying is you cant apply for federal or grad plus loans for the vet prep program. You’d have to do a private loan for just the vet prep program then in addition do the full federal loans for the actual 4 years of vet school on top of vet prep’s privste loan | Bruh… | Walk into a clinic with resume in hand or look online at places like craigslist and indeed for vet assistant job postings | Honestly just take it day by day and don’t feel like you have to prove you’re smart. In reality its dedication and consistency that are more important. If you arent in college yet then you practically are starting from square one and could mold your path however you like. I wasnt a fan of high school either and I found out when I got to college that it was the consistent 8-4 M-F schedule filled with classes that I didnt like and once I had the freedom to spend my time how I wanted then learning became fun. The fact you’re in an internship program the summer of your senior yesr of high school shows you’re ahead of most of your age already. The best thing you can do is start getting vet experience as early as you can, even if its a few hours here or there cause experience beats everything. | I feel like this isn’t super common because by time an animal is in Hospice/Pallative care then they are probably in pain and suffering and it might be more humane to euthanize then wait for them to pass naturally | I agree but, this would still fall under the scope of the GP. There isnt really a way to be a hospice only vet, unless maybe also did mobile euthanasia | The most important thing is where you want to practice as a vet after vet school. If you want to work in the US then try to attend an AVMA acreddited school or else the process can be very tricky and cost a lot. | I see what you’re saying but, a lot of this seems specific to vet school itself and even then every vet school is so different. \n",
      "\n",
      "The professors at my school are awesome and always treat the entire class like colleagues. As far as different speices we do a good mix of small animal and large animal but, we do lack in exotics which is a big interest of mine. I have found though that focusing on the main domestic species and then branching out later has been a lot more manageable than trying to learn so many species at once. How many people in your class and school in general want to be an Aquatics vet? It seems way more beneficial to the school to have another small animal research professor than hiring an Aquatics vet. Also being an Aquatics vet is awesome but, its very niche and there isnt demand if tons of people suddenly decided to go the aqautics route - like each aquarium has 1 or a few vets and besides that people arent bringing aquatic pets in that often and the ones that do only need 1 vet for their life.\n",
      "\n",
      "What school you go to also plays a big role, at my school the pathology department continously receives seal, sharks and other marine mammals from being close to the ocean. We also have the opportunity to work with an aquatic vet at a nearby science center. Have you tried applying at aquariums or doing a rotation at another school?\n",
      "\n",
      "No respect for degree or personal time is a common theme in general practice and varies where in the country you are. I would think right when you start doing Aquatics youll see a shift because the types of people to spend money on vet care for fish and marine animals are people that are passionate about that hobby and value your advice. Youd also have a lot of respect as an aquarium vet or you could work for the government and not talk to any public. I think this part will change drastically after rotations. The field is far from perfect in many ways and the schools are pretty underfunded which makes the journey really hard but, there are paths to happiness as a vet. You definitely dont have to give the field 30-40 years, you could do anything! Work as an aquatic vet for a few years then pivot and start an aquaculture business using your DVM for credibility and then you can build amazing aquascapes and look after the fish you put in there, theres lots of ideas! | These imperfections would be addressed more readily if people shared what school they are talking about but, I can understand why they wouldnt do that. Every vet school is drastically different so nothing can be done if noone knows where to address these problems. | You can still go into aquaculture as a vet and take care of the fish and maintain habitats. As an aquatic vet its gonna be hard to find companion animals as most people wouldnt do surgery on their pet fish. This was just an idea cause they mentioned they didnt want to work as a vet for the next 30-40 years | In a corporate owned clinic vets are paid a salary and have no control over pricing. $90 an exam fee was normal for my clinic when I worked there are you’re paying for a 30min slot of the vets time.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the ashes, people can get weird over that stuff. I’ve heard stories of clinics being sued for stuff the 3rd party place did by accident (group cremation vs single). It seems simple enough but, i’m sure they had their reasons not to do it. | You can take the majority at community college but, some of the upper division sciences may not be covered. It differs by college though | Yes you’ll just need to make sure you have all the pre-reqs in addition to your other classes before you apply. Heres a chart of what each school roughly requires:\n",
      "\n",
      "https://www.aavmc.org/assets/Site_18/files/VMCAS/VMCASprereqchart.pdf | I dont think it will be a big deal, especially with all your other grades being good. I know a lot of people who got into vet schools with way more C’s | https://www.aavmc.org/assets/Site_18/files/VMCAS/VMCASprereqchart.pdf\n",
      "\n",
      "This chart has the rundown of what most schools require as prereq classes (you can be any major). Its a few years old so check with each school but its right for the most part\n",
      "\n",
      "Only a very snall number of schools require the GRE and even they are trending away from them. The rest require no standardized tests. A few schools might make you do a Casper interview test after you submit your application but its not something you prepare for.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best advice would be to keep your GPA high and try to get veterinary hours as an assistant or tech during your spare breaks and summers | Your major doesnt matter in terms of getting vet experience. Join your schools pre-vet club for unique opportunities or look online and you should find vet assistant jobs no problem. How many science classes do you have left to take? I would really try to raise the 3.1 because it might be a red flag that you were in a non science major and had a much lower science GPA than your cumulative. This is cause pre-reqs are what matter the most and serve as background for the stuff you’ll learn in vet school and the majority of prereqs are in the science GPA. With a science major you would have many classes included in this science GPA so it wouldnt be an absolute reflection of pre-reqs but, as an english major the only science grades you will have are pre-reqs so the science GPA will be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Schools don’t mind a gap year but, usually people jam pack their gap year with vet / animal experiences. If you had a gap in experiences that spanned a few months cause you were traveling then that might be a red flag. Vacations are fine ofcourse but if you take off a significant part of the year then not sure how they will look at that.\n",
