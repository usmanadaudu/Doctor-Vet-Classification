My question is what in the world caused that to happen? I love Mysterium but feel very sketched out, yet idk if it was even their fault. What do you guys think? I’m skeptical of reinstalling it again. I had a some MYST in my account prior to uninstalling, I doubt I would get it back if I reinstalled right? Not the end of the world, I’m just happy to be online again although I missed a lot of meetings this morning.

You think it’s safer going with residential nodes or no difference? 🥂 ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tsbqed/security/i2wtq00/ | YES. Any more of a liability compared to something like ExpressVPN or any other popular centralized vpn? Given the nature of both i feel like it would be more prevalent with dVPNs but really don’t know ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tsbqed/security/i2wu0ju/ | Wow! Yeah seems the returns with Mysterium aren't great, I would have to enable whitelisting as well. Helium is a cool project. I wanted to buy a miner and antenna but all of the miners were sold out with a 6 month waiting period. I talked to this guy who does free installs but takes like 80% of the rewards which seemed pointless. Monero mining I don't know anything about.

Why would they do it if there aren't any benefits? Most people likely won't care if an app rating is a bit less than 5. Not like Mysterium gets money from reviews (unless something on google play does that?), and the chances of someone seeing the reviews and seeing all of \"Thanks\" and deciding to get the app and buy stuff is rare. They would likely see the bots and decide to leave, which brings me to my next point.

      "\"Ultimately I believe we could see services built for crunching data, also Apps and dApps using Mysterium as their secure communication channel between any 2 end points whenever they need one - for example to create a secure communication channel between a user and a server, or a user to another user, or a user and a device. This could be applied to any number of services which need a secure communication channel. For example it could be: payment apps like Paypal, Revolut or any of the wallet apps, communication apps like Snapchat or Whatsapp, e-commerce services such as Shoppify, then content delivery services such as Netflix trying to ensure their users can access content when traveling abroad, etc.\" - Robertas Visinskis\n",

People who don't like science but just want to help animals are the people who tend to burn out of vet school because they can't keep up, or if they can it's unsustainable for four years. | Someone from Germany can comment but I'm fairly certain most Germans speak English better than Americans. Europe is very multilingual. You should learn German but you'd be fine. Do your degree in England or Scotland and then move to Germany as they're generally accredited in the EU. | You can, but I'm not sure how many American schools are also accredited by the EAEVE. I think most British schools are. You would want to go to an EAEVE accredited school to move to Europe afterwards | Stats is the most challenging math you'll need to understand. The rest of it is multiplication and division. It's not hard math | You can only administer standard first aid, as you are effectively a lay person | You could definitely lose your license for trying to practice medicine on people\n",

      "Good Samaritan laws only protect you if you're providing reasonable first aid (chest compressions, applying pressure, washing a wound). If you as a vet go around trying to intubate people at the scene of a crash and provide ALS level care, you're absolutely fucked and they won't protect you at all | tourniquets fall under good samaritan care especially with american gun violence. look at Stop The Bleed for advice if you want. in fact as a vet to be i'd recommend supporting your local community by taking the course, becoming an instructor and training laypeople in hemorrhage control | Having a DVM isn't why you're referred to as doctor in clinic. Your job is distinct from your degree. You're referred to as doctor because you're licensed to practice vet medicine. | Do you really want to reinforce the Dr name as much as possible? | The general public will never understand most degree titles without substantial exposure to academia somehow. Many don't even really understand how MDs are different from PhDs. This is why I harp on about how title clarity is very important, more so in human medicine where many allied health fields have doctoral professional degrees these days (pharmD, DPT, DNP etc). | See I disagree. Your title comes from the job you are employed in and your medical license, and has nothing to do with your degree. It's a very america-centric thing to suggest that you are a doctor because of your DVM. What about MVBs, BVMSs, BVetMeds? Are they not doctors then? The DVM that never licenses or practices. They are a DVM but would you like your clients and nurses asking them for advice or diagnoses or orders in your clinic during a visit just because they have a DVM degree? | Your doctoral degree gives you access to the title in daily life but PhDs generally dont go around referring to themselves as Dr xyz in hospitals or clinics, except for the super self-important, because in that context doctor is assumed to refer to physician, MD or in our case veterinarian. Yes, when you get the degree you are a \"doctor\", but you're not able to take on the job of \"doctor\" in clinic until you hold a medical license. You can't give nurses med orders, you can't legally make diagnoses, you can't discuss prognosis or counsel owners, etc until you have the appropriate license to do so. Thus the title Dr. and the degree DVM mean slightly different things. There are DVMs who don't hold medical licenses that actually shouldn't be called doctor in clinic for example, as that is confusing to others, as much as y'all think it's devaluing to the degree. | But you have a license somewhere, which means something. If that non-practicing unlicensed DVM walked into your clinic, would you want your techs/nurses asking them for medical orders? To make diagnoses?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Licenses are transferrable. Experience and practice with a medical license makes you a doctor. In a hospital, the job of doctor should be reserved for those who can guide owners/patients towards medical decisions. Job and title are not the same thing. Sure, PhDs call themselves doctor all they want in shops, pubs etc but not in hospitals and clinics. | MVB, BVMS and BVetMed are veterinary degrees from AVMA accredited UK vet colleges, none of them have doctor in the title and they are all specifically undergraduate or master's degrees. People will never ever understand academic degree titles and I don't think we should expect them to. Does it really matter whether or not they understand our specific training pathways as long as they understand the qualification? They also don't understand the difference between human nursing, medical, osteopathic medical, dental, optometric and podiatric degrees although all of those professions can diagnose, prescribe and/or perform surgery to some extent (nursing as nurse practitioners). It feels to me like the only reason to try to force people to understand the training pathway analogy is to soothe the ego. It doesn't take anything away from you or I as vets if Joe blow, owner of princess, thinks our degree was 2 years instead of 4. They can take the care or leave it until they educate themselves and figure out not to prejudge professionals.\n",
      "Also I should point out that although it has doctor in the title, DVMs are undergraduate medical degrees. They are just second-entry undergraduate programs. | I think you're drinking the Kool aid a little bit here. DVMs are undergraduate level medicine courses even in the US. It has nothing to do with whether you've completed \"doctorate level coursework\" or not. It's got to do with whether you've qualified for a medical license by completing an AVMA accredited course. DVM is just a fancy flourish of letters to increase Americans sense of self-importance. It's an accomplishment to get one obviously, but it doesn't qualify you to practice the job of being a doctor. It qualifies you to get a license which allows you to practice the job of doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tbh my undergrad coursework was more rigorous and detailed than lots of my vet med course work. | this is an issue commonly discussed in human medicine but the principle applies here as well. do you think a nurse with a PhD in nursing should introduce themselves as Dr. xyz to patients? how about a pharmacist with a PharmD? DPT physiotherapist?\n",
      "\n",
      "what about MVBs, or BVetMeds? do they not get to call themselves doctor? there's no doctor in their veterinary degree title. RVTs who also have a research doctorate? do they get to introduce themselves as Dr. soandso to owners?\n",
      "\n",
      "your ability to fulfill a ROLE or JOB in a hospital is what makes you a doctor to the general public, not your degree title. youre conflating honorary titles of doctor in the social domain with the job of doctor in a hospital when they are separate things.\n",
      "\n",
      "yes obviously licensure in one state does not automatically hold bearing in any other state. once you have obtained the general substrates for a license (a veterinary degree, NAVLE completion in north america) you can complete locally specific substrates and apply for licenses with ease. in that sense, having a license in one place makes you roughly eligible to apply for licensure in another, especially when other boards request letters of good standing etc. | You're allowed to hate it. I couldn't possibly take myself so seriously. I suppose if you're working hard people will always recognize that before what's embroidered on your coat. | Correct, that's my entire point. A doctor can be a social title or it can be a job but for some people it's not both. For vets and MDs we are called doctor in the hospital because of our medical license rather than our doctoral degree.\n",
      "To be even more confusing, nurses can have research phds or DNPs which often qualify them as nurse practicioners. | Depends how hard you work in RVT school. I'd be willing to bet if a dedicated and focused student did a bachelor's program in vet technology, they could make their life a hell of a lot easier in vet school. | Your ability to do well in an MMI has very little to do with your ability to speak with clients. | If you think it's condescending to acknowledge someone's feelings the class is absolutely targeted specifically at you. | Who cares about how respected a degree is? If that's your rationale for getting one or the other and you hate the job in the end, you're going to have wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars. You should get the degree that allows you to do the work you want to do because YOU respect it, not because other people do | Everybody says they can't see themselves doing anything else but I find it's often simply because they don't actually know what jobs look like. You're attracted to this funny, inaccurate but idealized imagination of what being a vet is, but you should go and get some work experience in various fields to help you decide. | There's so much more to the challenges of this profession but that's a start. | So your first reason for regretting being in vet med is something you have total control over? Get a new job if you don't get along with your coworkers.\n",
      "Also letting people get under your skin gives them the greatest power over you. Get someone to help you manage difficult interactions. They literally don't have to ruin your day. | You sound salty. There is definitely a distinct advantage to having a solid knowledge base built on memorization of useful facts about medicine. Yes if you know how to problem solve and find information you can get there despite a weak knowledge base but having the memorization component gets you through the problem solving faster. Navle success obviously isn't the sole predictor of success as a vet but knowing things helps immensely instead of having to look them up constantly. | How else do you address a fundamental knowledge licensing exam to an entire profession with so many diverse end points? How else do you justify allowing vets to literally switch focuses at the drop of a hat? No, not every vet is going to be omniscient, but do you instead want to change licensing to be segregated by species? How do you ensure that vets have adequate training and knowledge to work with the species they about to operate on or prescribe meds to? I guarantee schools can't prepare us adequately and I do agree fundamentally that board licensing exams can be problematic, but there are some really questionable vets out there with licenses. What do you do instead? | specialization already exists. examples include surgery, anaesthesia, medicine, large animal medicine, oncology, opthalmology, general practice. we don't expect all vets to do all of these things expertly. i dont think you need to be omniscient or expert in all of these fields to pass the navle. you do have to have an understanding of vet med and be ready to enter any of these fields though. | I hope you don't talk to everybody in your life with so much derision. Obviously we aren't expected to be competent at everything after four years. Yes I agree that the standard of training in this profession is mediocre at times. I don't think it has to do with the navle | Grossed over 1mill as in you billed over 1mill for the practice? | Texas doesn't have an income tax does it? | I didn't become a vet because of a love of animals. Such an unfortunate cliche. | I think you should reflect on whether you actually feel hate for this person or whether it's something else that you're labelling as hate incorrectly. When we overuse the word hate to describe our feelings it probably makes us more negative. Better to stop and see if you're actually feeling resentment, insecurity, jealousy. Those are easier feelings to understand and move past than just hate. | You think vet med is far less important than software engineering? The science that much of our world today is built on? One of the most rapidly developing industries worldwide? I think you're confused. | typo, i meant to say far more important. my comment still stands. i think you vastly overestimate the importance of vets to your average individual. animal health care has always and will always take a back seat to many other things. if you wanted a \"fair\" salary as a \"doctor\" you should've gone to med school. having a doctoral degree means virtually nothing. people don't pay you millions of dollars just because your degree has the word doctor in it. | LOL you're funny | Then you must already understand that academic doctors don't have the same earning potential as medical doctors and it's essentially because of variability in demand for their distinct skill sets as well as the mechanisms through which procedural physicians bill for their services. Human health care is an inevitable expense so MDs will always have protected incomes. It's easy then to understand why vets will never be paid the same as human doctors, and if we were people would frankly just avoid seeking care for their animals | If you went into vet med just so people would have to call you doctor you chose the wrong profession. Vet med is a first entry degree in several countries, completed in 5-6 years of undergraduate work. Let's be honest, most people's undergrad was a four year lesson in how to study and be professional. Most people don't carry content forward from their undergrad which helps them practice medicine. | Vet med is absolutely doable if you are willing to develop your own interpersonal skills and resilience. There is definitely tons of abuse in the profession but if you can make it through whatever is thrown at you in vet school you start to set your own rules when you graduate. Once you're licensed you are absolutely in control and the field doesn't have to be a hell hole. It just tends to chew up people who don't develop their constitution on the way. | No unfortunately ethical teaching is mostly wasted on vets. | Because nobody actually follows the teaching, utilizes ethical frameworks, makes consistently balanced decisions, or acts in an ethical way. Tons of my classmates behave unethically all the time and they have it freshest in their minds. People just come to their knee jerk conclusion and defend why they consider their decision to be ethical. The righteous mind by Jonathan haidt provides some very good insight into this phenomenon. | a very gentle but incorrect attempt to analyze my perception. no, these are genuinely unethical decisions, its not a difference of ethical values. im fine with people having different personal ethics to me as long as there is no direct or indirect harm to others. my initial post was obviously hyperbole. many vets do ethical things. my criticism is that they often do it intuitively rather than rationally, and vet students can learn ethical frameworks but act hypocritically in spite of this, or fail to apply them to their own actions. | God that's horrific advice. I agree on sticking it out but definitely don't handle rotations like that | I'm struggling to remember anatomy and parasites as well, and I've been at the top of my class for three years. I wouldn't fuss too much, just do your best, get it done with and decide what you want to do once your life has settled down a bit. I'm not typically a sunk cost fallacy type of person but you've invested so much already and this degree opens so many doors for you, just do your best while maintaining your sanity. | 1/3 of vets and owners also think that placebo improves osteoarthritis so let's remember our cognitive biases in reassessing these animals. | Sedation | Dont get a MacBook, they charge literally hundreds to thousands more for the same components as a PC. You're literally just paying for the name. It makes zero sense as a student. | They hold their value because of their brand and consistency in structural manufacture. Sure there are PCs that degenerate quickly but there are tons of PC manufacturers that make machines which retain processing speed and structural integrity over equally long periods of time. PC is still far better value, especially for a student. | It's because you have poor teachers who aren't taking the time to correct your approach. | I'm not at Bristol but I'm also a mature Canadian who attends vet school in the UK and I've spoken to a Bristol student, it sounds like a well run program. | They make efforts to ensure the courses are all standardized but I would definitely have preferred Bristol or any other school over RVC | Most animal products and byproducts are associated with some degree of harm, death is probably the least deplorable form of animal suffering to be honest. I don't know why people fixate so much on animal slaughter when most of it is aimed to be done humanely. It's the other harms associated with farming that I find more shocking, like lameness, mastitis, untreated infection and nutritional disease. If we're going to use animals for food the absolute least we can do is provide them with solid quality of life while we have them alive. | Organic food is a marketing scam to begin with and yeah I'll bet it has serious welfare implications. I've not spent time on an organic farm and I probably won't ever as I don't intend to practice on farm animals but it's not surprising at all. | Best to pick a school that is avma accredited and teaches in your first language. Also be aware that UK schools and some other vet programs in English speaking countries do not award DVMs, but an equivalent typically at the bachelor's level. Lots of north American students at my school refer to themselves incorrectly as DVM students but if the label really matters to you then you should consider attending a north American school instead. | Sounds super passive aggressive and unnecessary. Imagine spending all that time trying to covertly convince other people that you're right and they're wrong instead of just directly addressing concerns as they come up. | I started at 29 and I'm far from the oldest in my class | Masters degrees do nothing for you as an Ontario applicant unless you are extremely productive in publishing. OVC is exceptionally difficult to get admitted to and not somewhere to hang your hat on. | Canadian schools are impractical for most students to apply to. | No Canadian bank will give you enough money on a student line of credit to attend international schools. | Nobody can get into in province schools. There are SO many students wanting to pursue the profession, enough to easily fix the vet shortage. They just can't get accepted in province. The system is actually completely broken. I got rejected from OVC three cycles in a row, now I just don't feel motivated to return after having to go internationally for my education. Ontario would have to pay me the difference in my tuition for me to return home at this point. Instead OVC has created 20 rural seats with Lakehead for students to try and lie their way into just to get admitted. | Nobody posting on Reddit asking about international vet schools can get into Canadian schools. | You need to apply for AVMA accredited schools to write the navle and work in Canada. Eaeve accreditation doesnt qualify you for a Canadian license as far as I know, without doing lots of additional, expensive licensing exams | OVC won't even interview students with less than a 90% average these days, despite their grade cutoff being 75%. The admissions process is a black box and we have no way to get help with improving our odds of admission, the school refuses to discuss these things. Students also seem to have a distinct advantage having gone to Guelph so in my experience if you went to any other university the odds were stacked against you. | Yep, I'm just saying the federal and provincial loans are not even close to enough to be able to pay tuition let alone afford the education. You essentially need to have wealthy parents to attend international vet school. | this is absolutely true, i know many of them from my vet program, but they are typically not canadians. the reality is that most canadian vet med applicants know of nothing outside of their provincial program. they all try really hard to get in and some don't even learn about international schools until their first or second rejection. the only students going to these international schools right away without a thought are the ones with independently wealthy parents with connections. most students who end up going internationally have tried in province several times already and are only going as a last resort. | OVC may not specifically select for guelph students but there is a guelph advantage in being in close proximity to the FVC, getting advice from vet student friends, having easy access to the limited feedback the school offers. i applied for years to OVC, got rejected with no explanation every year. strong candidate on paper, fantastic references from vets, human medical professionals, so much support from all of my colleagues, extracurriculars and strong work experiences. ill never know what they wanted me to say or not say, or what i got rejected for. all i know is i wasted three years of my life waiting for that school when i could be in internships right now. i am nothing special, and there are many extremely competent students in the exact same position that i was in, some of them are my classmates now. | No it won't as long as the school is AVMA accredited and you satisfy the other qualities and qualifications these programs are looking for. Just for your info if you're planning to attend school in the UK and it's even within the realm of possibility that you might want to pursue training here, UK internships won't even generally consider vets without 1-2+ years of GP experience. | Pay in the UK is extremely poor for new grads compared to Canada and the US. I would go elsewhere if I were you. Stay in north America if possible. | Sounds shady AF. | Work on your interpersonal skills and bring it up with management. It's not your place to manage this person, you're only responsible for your own reactions and responses to rudeness. | Sounds like toxic management. If this is an ongoing thing they need to be involved. Trying direct interpersonal management yourself is fine for the first time or two but it's not your job to discipline other employees. I personally would be telling my management I'll be finding a better workplace if it's really intolerable. That's not on you at all. | Probably not every program has a policy like that but it doesn't sound totally unreasonable. You need to be competent in many disciplines as a vet. | Your legs will adapt to the standing but it's an active job and will tire you out most days anyway. Try to make sure you aren't just standing still, if you dont need to be perfectly still try to shift your weight between your feet and push up on your tip toes periodically to prevent blood stasis through muscle pump action. | Grades definitely matter to some extent but they're not the sole determinant of the quality of your practice. You have all your life to refine your knowledge and some people are poor test takers. You definitely have to have an understanding of the material to potentially score well on tests but you don't have to score well on tests to necessarily have a strong understanding of the material.\n",
      "The other option to consider is that you're actually overestimating your understanding of the content. Test results aren't everything but they do tell you something about what you know. | I loved anatomy, physiology and pharmacology in my undergrad and wanted to be an MD but didn't want to go through all the silly games and hoop jumping to be given the opportunity to apply. Vet med was more attainable. | I definitely think you'd struggle to say there's no correlation at all. It's not the only determining factor but vets that have a broader knowledge base definitely have the potential to be better vets | Correct, read my other post. There is still a correlation, because you have to know things to be a vet at all and really good vets know a lot of things. Obviously there are outliers when it comes to test performance but you can't say there's NO correlation, just that it's not a perfect correlation. | Yeah the system is definitely broken. Vet admissions are such a horrific gameshow of just making yourself fit into a perfect little box.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it makes you feel any better, I got into a UK vet school and it's intensely underwhelming to me anyway. Would've definitely rather stayed in Canada or the US. I've been trying to transfer since I started. | That's because RVC already admits far more students than they have the resources to support. The graduating class is the largest in the world by a long shot. | It's aberystwyth students not Harper Keele, but you're right. It's overpopulated and they just keep stuffing more and more students into a single year. I can't stand it | I can't wait to get out. Feels like such a waste of my money. | If you're training in the UK this is expected. In the US or Canada, almost frowned on but not at all impossible | Wish I knew before coming here to study. I'm absolutely not waiting to see gp before an internship. I'm too old for that. Guess I'll have to go back to north America again before returning to the UK. | Don't become a vet if it's only because you love animals. Volunteer at a shelter or rescue if that's what you want. Become a vet because you find medicine fascinating and love helping people solve problems. | The only way to remedy that is to practice and ask for graded (incremental) opportunities. | You can definitely teach empathy, it's a skill just like any other. What you can't do is make someone with shitty behavior realize they are they issue, they have to figure that one out. | Probably to states with better protection of women's healthcare rights and access, seeing as how so much of our workforce is women\n"

      "I think your position is not an uncommon one. I've seen it many times in real life and seen it on this subreddit even more. I've been working in vet med for 15 years and have worked every position in the hospital at some point. I currently offer my relief services to 5 hospitals and have worked at nearly 20 in my time ranging from small single doctor GP clinics to university ECC. All this to say that, in my experience, this happens to even boarded specialists at any and all levels.\n",
      "\n",
      " I've worked with brilliant technicians who I would trust over some doctors and whose advice is absolutely golden. If you have one of those in your clinic then be a sponge and learn all you can from them. Their experience is invaluable and a good tech is a life and license saver. You will make mistakes and they will help you catch them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, a substantial amount of the techs/assistants you're working with will not be these people. A large amount of the work force for nurses are on the job trained and have only worked at maybe 1-2 hospitals for a few years. They don't know what they don't know, and I can say this because I went through that gauntlet myself. The more I've learned the quicker I am to pause and think about why someone may have done something they did. There's a good chance the people giving you trouble are the ones who fall in this category. It boils my blood to see how pervasive it is to have nurses who don't even understand why decisions are being made criticize doctors for them. There are multiple boarded specialists I've seen get shit on by nurses who when pressed for more details about exactly what they did wrong could either only provide wrong information, are lacking SIGNIFICANT context clues or base knowledge to even understand what they're judging, or just don't have anything worth while and just like the drama. The people who lack this knowledge are the quickest to judge and those who know the most tend to be more patient and understanding. This has been true for pretty much every single one of my 18 clinics I've worked at. \n",
      "\n",
      "My best advice is to see where this advice is coming from. If it's from a trusted source who means well then absolutely forget your ego and absorb anything you can. If it's from the clinic drama queen with the over inflated ego then just ignore it and move on. You have too many more important things to do than pay those type of people even a minute of your day | Unless youre refusing on calls (which is only a very small percentage of surgeons) then expect to work \\~40-50 hours completely excluding your on-call time. Its what made me stop pursuing surgery as a specialty. I looked around at every surgeon at all the hospitals I worked at and realized not a single one had a work/life balance I would be happy with | Very classic case of them thinking they know way more than they do. They quite literally don't know enough to even differentiate what makes a good vs bad vet. You have a toxic coworker problem not a you problem | Depends on what your definition of worth it is. It's a large investment upfront and requires the ability to constantly be learning and growing. There's a ton of responsibility and half your job is basically client communication. Being a good doctor is only half the job because of this unfortunate fact. Debt load is high but so can the salaries be. I do relief, can make anywhere from 200-400k depending how hard I want to work, set my own hours, get to do something I love and live exactly the type of life I want. For me it's absolutely worth it but for many people it's absolutely not. If I had to do GP I'd absolutely quit and change fields. As with anything it's a bit what you make of it | I work in SoFlo. The work isn't as reliable as COVID times but for me it's still there. Location dependent for sure. I tend to work at 24h specialty centers and most of them I just called in and asked to be put in contact with whoever could tell me if they needed any additional relief assistance. Pretty much everyone has been happy to talk | I get it on my own! I'm child free and in good health so it's only like $360 for me so would be pretty minimal savings if I signed on somewhere compared to the freedom and tax deductions having an S-Corp allows me | Definitely one perk of being in my situation. VCA actually has really good health care if you are looking for a place | Yea I think it's like 34 hours for full time there? Could be off +/- 2. Unfortunately I'm not sure what insurance they have though. I did briefly get into negotiations with them but ended up staying on my own | I dont necessarily think you need an internship with your level of experience but definitely need to be working at a place with good mentorship for a while. I wouldnt be rushing into overnights alone, for instance. You likely could handle the majority of things but things can get complicated quickly in ER and not having to have someone to bounce something off of \"hey this sounds reasonable right?\" can put a big burden on you if youre not prepared for it | Sounds like youre working at an absolute dumpster fire of a hospital. Get out ASAP and completely forget anything those garbage vets taught you. You can make it friend there are definitely better hospital (probably >90-95% of them) out there | Same in SoFlo\n"

      "x. Many many people get stuck after rotating and are unable to secure a residency position; its very competitive.

She was perfect, I couldn’t understand what was happening to her her last few months, especially when it was punctuated by a no aggressive episodes for a few weeks when my vet prescribed fluoxetine to see if that would help, and it did until it didn’t and then everything got so much worse. In hindsight, I see her mentation changes and lethargy and offness I blamed on the fluoxetine, but was probably due to whatever was going on in her head. Time is a cheap MRI means so much to me - I had thought she needed an MRI when everything first began, but my vet advised the outcome wouldn’t change and my family said I’d be insane to do that just to know so I didn’t do it. Then after the final attack, I knew it’d be for me not for her and that felt wrong. It’s been hard now because I wish I had the closure of knowing, but her behavior made it clear something mg was very wrong with her and my vet assures me it was likely something neurological or intracranial that wouldn’t have been fixable.\n",

      "Yeah, my biggest critique of a lot of these hospitals is a lack of teaching hospitals. My school has interns, residents, 4th years, 3rd years, and students from the Caribbean schools without a teaching hospital. We barely have the case load and staff to adequately teach these students. Adding more students in classes does nothing to remedy the need for more places to practice and hone clinical skills such as S/N, diagnosis, client communication, etc, etc, etc. Many of these schools have no plans to build a clinical hospital alongside. So their students will be sent in to hospitals that may not be able to adequately teach them. | I would go for cheapest. I went to a tiny state school for undergraduate, was one of the top picks for my first choice school and my friend got into Cornell. You can save money, and use your time wisely to get involved in extracurriculars, research, and veterinary experience that will help you stand out a lot more than a prestigious school. | Leptospirosis (urine) and rabies (saliva) are the big ones. Bites can cause bacterial infections. | I mean, if you have a passion for shelters, there is a ton of work you can do to take the management, advocacy, and organization off the vets to make a big impact. Oftentimes, it's not just lack of vets or techs willing to do this work, it's lack of supplies, money, and organization power. I've worked with vets who can spay a dog every ten minutes. If they had access to an environment to help them, they could make a huge impact. But they're hindered by the legalities of operating, using controlled drugs, etc. | Yes! I loved sending new owners home with a magnet of our local ER. My parents still have one, and it was very useful when my dog's eye started bleeding and they panicked. | If you've finished the prerequisite classes, yes. You'll have to look at the schools you're interested in to see their requirements. | The Vet at Noah's Ark was so good to me! | I would say, because I'm sure grades and everything will be available on transcripts. On the write in section, just explain your dismissal and the academic steps you've taken since, as well as experience gained. | My advisor recommended I break them down into research and veterinary experience to help create a diverse portfolio. | Oof, that's rough. If she's consistently not getting asked to interview, she's not likely getting culled in a strict GPA cut-off or there is something in her written work of her application that is getting her ruled out. Without feedback, it's hard to say why. | It has to do with what the national board requires. I'd recommend looking at the specific residency you're interested in requires to get a clear answer. Internships are typically required and may help with being competitive, but are not required for every specialty.\n",

Idk if that’s accurate though | So there’s no room for growth either? Just stays 100k forever? | Thanks for the info 🙏🏻 | One thing that really helped me is looking up consensus statements on google about various diseases. Know the diseases deeply, not just surface level. Understand the physiology behind diseases—this deeper understanding makes all the difference. This made me raise my score 100 points and I passed with ease. | I would love to hear more about your experiences!! | I have SEVERE anxiety and dissociation and I also debated asking for double time, as anxiety truly is a disability during tests. However, I ultimately decided to not do that (for my 2nd attempt) and I’m SO GLAD I didn’t!!! Two days of the test is even more stressful than one day imo. Go with your gut. My gut told me to not ask for more time and it paid off for me. | I was 2 questions away from passing my first attempt and I literally wanted to drop out I was so depressed. Everyone around was celebrating—i lived with two girls who passed. It was living hell. My best advice is to not think about it at all. I started going on long runs and watching good movies. I didn’t retake it until after graduation when I was refreshed. Your mind can do crazy things telling you that you’ll never pass, what if what if what if.

I am indeed a woman. Sorry for you too, being the support system to us vets is not easy. | Haha well at least someone thinks that. We weren’t even recognized by Peloton as “real doctors” for a while lol | True that. And 100% yeah being a PCP is difficult.\n",

The caution for use in pets with a history of certain cancers also isn't really based on anything from the tox data for apoquel specifically, it comes from data on less selective JAK inhibitors (such as Jakafi and Xeljanz) used on the human side. Theoretically blocking JAK1 (and therefore IL2 and IL4) carries some risk of inhibiting NK Cell activation which should still be considered in patients with a history of certain types of cancer. | Join ARAV if you haven't already!

      "\n",
      "I would say that GPA is more important than experience during that time. You can always spend more time getting experience but GPAs are often hard to change once you have a bunch of credits. A good GPA isnt necessary but, will make your path so much easier. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also in terms of experience, try to get some vet hours during the summers inbetween school and in a few different areas of vet med. At the least try to have both small and large animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than that enjoy undergrad and learn how to study properly. Memorization gets you far but, learning the why behind the material (esp for things like physiology) will make your life so much easier. This is very true for classes like cell biology and microbio where the topics in vet school build on these foundations | For me I applied to internships on the jobs tab of AZA.com and then also on my local zoo’s website. I got an internship the next summer in their tropical forest and comissary departments and worked there 2-3 days a week doing that. After the summer there was a job opening and they couldnt find anyone so they offered the keeper job to me and I did that for a year. It was a really cool job but, I made minimim wage with no benefits so it would have been tough to pivot that into a career. | Have you worked in a vet clinic? That’s your first step to see if you like the day to day job of a vet. It’s very different than most people think and comes with a lot of hardships. I was a zookeeper (wildlife caretaker) for a little over a year and its tough to make it into a career because we were paid minimum wage with no benefits. Larger zoo’s probably have a bit more options but, even then if the vets at the zoo make 100-120k ish then the keepers would be lucky to make half of that. Zoo’s don’t make lots of money and usually need lots of government support making most salaries on the low end | If you include the actual salary you’d get a lot more interest | Usually its a super competitive internship then residency for zoo animals specifically! Was your school AVMA acredited, if so then looking for internships is a good stsrt, if not you’ll need to get licensed in the US | It doesnt seem like you have much perspective on vet school itself. You should not have to develop career and internship opportunities while in vet school if you don’t want to specialize. Vet tech school is different but, thats not what we are talking about | Best course is looking on craigslist or walking into a clinic with resume in hand. Its entirely possibly there are liability issues with someone under 18 working so you may have to wait depending on your local laws. If you can’t get vet experience before college then dont stress, just use all the summers for experience and maybe a little during the terms if it fits with your schedule and then you’ll still have plenty of hours by time you apply.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you find no vet experience then animal experience is part of the application too. Anything to do with animals (dog walking, helping a farm, pets, shows, etc.). So you can also get hours there in the meantime. | Sometimes its simply a numbers thing, sometimes its the essay or LORS. For ISU you need majority of your hours to be large animal from what i’ve seen. Also the way ISU calculates science GPA inflates everyones so higher GPA’s have less sway there | The best way is to volunteer or work in a clinic. There are many hardships in this field that you need to experience to see if its right for you | If you do biology then 90% of your classes and pre-reqs will overlap. If you do physics then you will do all the physics requirements then have to take pre-reqs that physics doesnt require but vet school does on the side. Physics doesnt require genetics, physio, microbio, cell bio to name a few so youd be taking these on the side and paying extra. For example the upper div physics classes you will take wont count on the app but, upper div bio classes will count for the app. | Having a bachelors definitely makes you more competitive because you will have more upper division science classes that way but, I dont think applying with just pre-reqs is a bad idea if you have a good GPA and experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best way is the way that will save most money before vet school so I recommend doing community college for 2 years then transferring and doing upper divs at a 4 year college | So theres 2 types of experience; Animal and veterinary. If you work with a vet then its veterinary and that looks a little better just cause its exposure to the industry (and the application is proving you know what its like). Animal experience is any work with animals with no vet present, this still looks great on an application but if you had to choose then do veterinary | Surplus of vets is kind of a stretch. Maybe surplus of GP in certain areas but, we are definitely lacking in other areas. One big factor is location. There are no vet schools in a lot of states and that means there are generally less vets going to those states. For example the dakotas, nevada, new mexico, wyoming, etc. dont have vet schools so the only people moving to those states to be vets are people who left them for vet school originally. Adding schools to those states would help those local areas retain vets and help the states as a whole. Where my family is from in NYC there is a couple week waiting time for most clinics in the area so I would argue that there is still a need for more clinics. In addition more and more people don’t want to use corporations and seek out mom and pop vet services. | Peabody DVM on youtube and the university of minnesota wet lab videos are grest for anatomy! | I also heard vet prep itself isnt covered by federal loans so if you have to get private loans just for the pre program then its not worth it | What i’m saying is you cant apply for federal or grad plus loans for the vet prep program. You’d have to do a private loan for just the vet prep program then in addition do the full federal loans for the actual 4 years of vet school on top of vet prep’s privste loan | Bruh… | Walk into a clinic with resume in hand or look online at places like craigslist and indeed for vet assistant job postings | Honestly just take it day by day and don’t feel like you have to prove you’re smart. In reality its dedication and consistency that are more important. If you arent in college yet then you practically are starting from square one and could mold your path however you like. I wasnt a fan of high school either and I found out when I got to college that it was the consistent 8-4 M-F schedule filled with classes that I didnt like and once I had the freedom to spend my time how I wanted then learning became fun. The fact you’re in an internship program the summer of your senior yesr of high school shows you’re ahead of most of your age already. The best thing you can do is start getting vet experience as early as you can, even if its a few hours here or there cause experience beats everything. | I feel like this isn’t super common because by time an animal is in Hospice/Pallative care then they are probably in pain and suffering and it might be more humane to euthanize then wait for them to pass naturally | I agree but, this would still fall under the scope of the GP. There isnt really a way to be a hospice only vet, unless maybe also did mobile euthanasia | The most important thing is where you want to practice as a vet after vet school. If you want to work in the US then try to attend an AVMA acreddited school or else the process can be very tricky and cost a lot. | I see what you’re saying but, a lot of this seems specific to vet school itself and even then every vet school is so different. \n",
      "\n",
      "The professors at my school are awesome and always treat the entire class like colleagues. As far as different speices we do a good mix of small animal and large animal but, we do lack in exotics which is a big interest of mine. I have found though that focusing on the main domestic species and then branching out later has been a lot more manageable than trying to learn so many species at once. How many people in your class and school in general want to be an Aquatics vet? It seems way more beneficial to the school to have another small animal research professor than hiring an Aquatics vet. Also being an Aquatics vet is awesome but, its very niche and there isnt demand if tons of people suddenly decided to go the aqautics route - like each aquarium has 1 or a few vets and besides that people arent bringing aquatic pets in that often and the ones that do only need 1 vet for their life.\n",
      "\n",
      "What school you go to also plays a big role, at my school the pathology department continously receives seal, sharks and other marine mammals from being close to the ocean. We also have the opportunity to work with an aquatic vet at a nearby science center. Have you tried applying at aquariums or doing a rotation at another school?\n",
      "\n",
      "No respect for degree or personal time is a common theme in general practice and varies where in the country you are. I would think right when you start doing Aquatics youll see a shift because the types of people to spend money on vet care for fish and marine animals are people that are passionate about that hobby and value your advice. Youd also have a lot of respect as an aquarium vet or you could work for the government and not talk to any public. I think this part will change drastically after rotations. The field is far from perfect in many ways and the schools are pretty underfunded which makes the journey really hard but, there are paths to happiness as a vet. You definitely dont have to give the field 30-40 years, you could do anything! Work as an aquatic vet for a few years then pivot and start an aquaculture business using your DVM for credibility and then you can build amazing aquascapes and look after the fish you put in there, theres lots of ideas! | These imperfections would be addressed more readily if people shared what school they are talking about but, I can understand why they wouldnt do that. Every vet school is drastically different so nothing can be done if noone knows where to address these problems. | You can still go into aquaculture as a vet and take care of the fish and maintain habitats. As an aquatic vet its gonna be hard to find companion animals as most people wouldnt do surgery on their pet fish. This was just an idea cause they mentioned they didnt want to work as a vet for the next 30-40 years | In a corporate owned clinic vets are paid a salary and have no control over pricing. $90 an exam fee was normal for my clinic when I worked there are you’re paying for a 30min slot of the vets time.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the ashes, people can get weird over that stuff. I’ve heard stories of clinics being sued for stuff the 3rd party place did by accident (group cremation vs single). It seems simple enough but, i’m sure they had their reasons not to do it. | You can take the majority at community college but, some of the upper division sciences may not be covered. It differs by college though | Yes you’ll just need to make sure you have all the pre-reqs in addition to your other classes before you apply. Heres a chart of what each school roughly requires:\n",
      "\n",
      "https://www.aavmc.org/assets/Site_18/files/VMCAS/VMCASprereqchart.pdf | I dont think it will be a big deal, especially with all your other grades being good. I know a lot of people who got into vet schools with way more C’s | https://www.aavmc.org/assets/Site_18/files/VMCAS/VMCASprereqchart.pdf\n",
      "\n",
      "This chart has the rundown of what most schools require as prereq classes (you can be any major). Its a few years old so check with each school but its right for the most part\n",
      "\n",
      "Only a very snall number of schools require the GRE and even they are trending away from them. The rest require no standardized tests. A few schools might make you do a Casper interview test after you submit your application but its not something you prepare for.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best advice would be to keep your GPA high and try to get veterinary hours as an assistant or tech during your spare breaks and summers | Your major doesnt matter in terms of getting vet experience. Join your schools pre-vet club for unique opportunities or look online and you should find vet assistant jobs no problem. How many science classes do you have left to take? I would really try to raise the 3.1 because it might be a red flag that you were in a non science major and had a much lower science GPA than your cumulative. This is cause pre-reqs are what matter the most and serve as background for the stuff you’ll learn in vet school and the majority of prereqs are in the science GPA. With a science major you would have many classes included in this science GPA so it wouldnt be an absolute reflection of pre-reqs but, as an english major the only science grades you will have are pre-reqs so the science GPA will be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Schools don’t mind a gap year but, usually people jam pack their gap year with vet / animal experiences. If you had a gap in experiences that spanned a few months cause you were traveling then that might be a red flag. Vacations are fine ofcourse but if you take off a significant part of the year then not sure how they will look at that.\n",
