I’m in an area that has a serious shortage of emergency trained vets, so much so that there’s been a pivot to regular vets not doing emergency triage, and not being able to recognize emergencies. \\n\\nIs there a basic certification that’s available so that pet owners can know when it’s time for the ER?|[deleted]|[deleted]|I agree with some of the below threads. Pay varies from state and I’ve also found big cities tend to pay more than hospitals in burbs or rural areas. For instance, I’m not certified and as a tech in Boston, MA I make $27/hour but in Chicago, IL I made $23/hour. That being said, I live with my boyfriend and having dual incomes is honestly the only way I can afford to live.\\n\\nI know moving for a job is a big thing consider but maybe not a bad idea to see what’s out there. I’ve also learned to not be afraid to advocate for yourself. Tell these jobs with the low rates that you’ve gotten more competitive offers (how will they know if you’re lying??) and drive that price up.

Just the island life is expensive.|When you get your loans the first thing taken out, before your survival needs like food water and rent, is tuition. So out of the 20k or so you’re left with 5 k to survive on for an entire semester. You can use this to your discretion. I would not take out another loan for vet prep.|I used my unsubsidized loan for vetprep. I took out the max approved amount.|Wait. I’m talking about vet prep. It’s an online navle study system. Not anything with the school. It’s 700 bucks.|I had enough of my own savings to pay for everything other than tuition the first two years. My family paid for tuition the first half. The remainder of vet school I used federal unsubsidized loans. Whatever I was approved for I took out. I did not use any grad plus loans or private loans. My mother paid for my rent the last two years. I had 0 debt from undergrad|So total cost of having permission to be in the building and on the vet school roster was 240k with living expenses included. They didn’t teach me anything I didn’t know.

Nothing can prepare you for the amount of bullshit they want you to know. It’s just memory games. You don’t learn anything until you start practicing.|I hated school.

I was not a fan of school by any means. I love the profession though outside of academia.|Please lemme know to if anyone can recommend any equine vet related stuff maybe ?|Even though they count for credits. You will still have to pay the same amount for the next semester. I maxed out my externship credits hoping I would lower my costs the next semester in lesser required electives.

Wasn’t till the third time, that I was out of school not being forced to work in the clinic 80 hours a week making salads for tortoises or soaps for doctors that I had time to actually sleep and study. Also go to a doctor and get ur blood and hormones checked. I found out I was low testosterone and it definitely helped me pass starting TRT. I put off going to the doctor for 6 years total because of vet school. Was just too busy. But vet prep. Try to do the questions in 1 hour blocks on the timed section and then take a 20 min break. Then go back and read all the explanations. If you don’t understand something. Then go to Merck and read about it. That’s what I did.|Focus on getting into vet school first. It’s extremely difficult. Then focus on passing the courses. The course load is nothing like you’ll ever experience in ur life. They force 8 years of education down ur throat in 4 years  and then demand you pass a 360 question test on rediculous veterinary knowledge before you can get ur license. While ur on clinics you will see if you like the internship/academia approach. Dont worry about specialties now. Focus on getting in and how the f you’re gonna pay for it.|The vet schools are atrocious what they are able to get away with in the US. JUST ABOUT 130k for in state tuition, or 220k for out of state. And that doesn’t include insurance, living expenses, etc.  Every grade is based on one multiple choice test and you have to read the class notes to pass so there’s No point in going to lecture. They force you to be a glorified technician in clinics and work absurd hours because there are no regulations on student labor. During corona they abused the fuck out of us. You just wear a white coat so everyone knows you’re paying to be a slave. Go to wherever is cheapest and study like hell for navle. My school didn’t prepare me for navle. I wish I went to Germany. They just force you to assimilate to their country. Which is reasonable imo. Just difficult while learning medicine and German culture.|Atleast on the timer section. Since the test is in April there is not much time to complete the timed and not timed sections.|If you are retaking in April. Really focus on practice questions. Especially timed ones. Then read the explanations. It covers the most material and removes the time wasted you will take making guided and study materials. I used vet prep. The third time I competed it to 97 percent. I passed test this time. Maybe use zuku. I also would read a little additional in material on the questions , whether I got wrong or right on Merck veterinary manual.|I viewed vet prep not as similar to navle, but as a fun way to learn the material. It was much better to learn and read through the question format than to just read random info all day. Challenging yourself to do well and get questions right was way more fun. What was annoying was reading all the explanations but it really reinforced the information about the species and random facts you may need to know or see.|I really want you to pass. Cause waiting till next November sucks so much. It’s what I had to do. Take as many vacation and sick days from school to study. I focused too much on not failing school cause I told myself I could retake the navle for 700 but if I mess up a semester I have to pay 30k plus living expenses for a year repeat.|Focus on the power pages and the powerlectures on questions you really don’t get.

You are only on this earth once. Do what you want. Just know vet school is full of hormonal women who aren’t married that think education and a career will fill that hole. It was a miserable time for me as a man. I just kept my mouth shut as much as a could and went home immediately from school. Found the cool guys in the class to hang with. The residents were so fuckin miserable cause they get paid next to nothing and could’ve gone right out into private practice to make tons of money. Just know you need good grades and a tough class cload to prove to you handle the demands of vet school. It is designed so that you cannot work while being vet school. They spread 8 years of education over 4 years and you are taking a new class every few weeks while 4 other classes over lap and end at random times while new ones start. Clinics you need to work against your will and your opinion means nothing and will sometimes even bother the residents if you know more. They take it as a challenge to their authority rather than you caring about the patient and the medicine; because they’re mostly women. But I would do it again. I learned a lot about women and will probably never get married.|A lot of ERs do mentorship but you\\'ll need to ask around. \\n\\nIf you wanna dip ur toe- Modern Animal does some urgent care. I know they do both GP and urgent care so it\\'s a nice mix. No clue about pay logistics etc, but this is appealing for those who wanna do a mix. \\n\\nPersonally would not recommend an internship! Most ERs don\\'t care about it and have new grad type programs/mentorships that would service you faaaar better in terms of pay, experience, and overall progress. Internships where I am in California are like 70k for 80 hour weeks (including being on call nights, like maybe a week of PTO etc.). You\\'ll probably get really proficent at surgery and very comfortable, but at what cost? New grad vets at the emergency i work at (i\\'m a tech there, but a vet student as well) start at 125k as new grads. They have mentorship, a schedule for being comfortable/proficent with surgeries etc. You\\'ll get more than enough experience going straight into ER as a new grad role. I know they have something about a variety of different surgeries that needed to be signed off by a more senior doctor (watching a GI surgery, doing a GI surgery etc.)|Highly circumstance and location dependent.  You need a lawyer with experience in non-competes to answer these types of questions.  I would not make a potentially huge financial decision such as this based on what other redditors have experienced.|I hope someone sues the living hell out of this organization and that they lose the contract for this test for licensing. In no way is it any test of veterinary competence. It is merely only for hazing. Since the previous gen had to take it, so do we and it never changes. I have no idea how unclear questions of communication, seahorse euthanasia, and pig diarrhea have to do with me doing dentals, surgery, and physical exams every day. I had 0 questions on anesthesia, 1 on surgery. And veterinary schools are horrible as well. I never was able to, or taught to extract one tooth during my education. I merely paid to be a glorified technician in a white coat and to show up and be told all my thoughts are wrong because i had too much experience in private practice. Every test was multiple choice and tested no ability other than to regurg random garbage the professor thought were cool.|I am so sorry you didn’t pass. I had to take it three times. Passed by razor think margins this time but that all that matters. My advice. Complete vetprep. And the last month, I was only doing questions in 1 hour sections. Maybe 4-5 times a day. But I additionally read every answer explanation after too. I was able to quit my job and move home and study really hard. Beating this rediculous test is all about studying, training for the 7 hour grind, and hopefully getting a test with questions you know you can answer correctly.|Only 5 times.

The extra time you get for breaks and to take the second half the next day sounded awesome. For me it didn’t help. Either I knew the answer or I didn’t. Really focus on the epidemiology. Those are freebies if you understand the specificity and sensitivity questions. I would try to complete vet prep and use the timed section the most. Use the non timed questions when you’re just relaxing but take time to do 1hour sections similar to the test. I can’t tell you how much it helped my stamina and to view the test as sections rather than individual questions. It also helps you make quicker decisions on questions you don’t know so you can focus on some questions you can reason out. Just such a bad test. They need to get rid of it.|They remove all the bad questions, after the test has been taken. How intelligent right? Rather than making sure the test has fair questions before it is taken…. Genius.|Focus on vet school first. It mostly degrades your will to want to stay in academia. It is extremely toxic. If anything, surgery alone is the best speciality because you learn how to fix things and too many vets in the field refuse to do surgery for 1 not having the time, two not being able to charge appropriately, and 3 they can make more money doing rooms. Internal medicine you can teach yourself. Also…the schools rely on radiology to do the ultrasounds where in private practice, if you want to get anything done as an internist, you need to learn how to ultrasound and interpret yourself. So I would get ur DVM. Work for a year. Then go do an ultrasonography course  where they teach you in a group how to scan. Then study internal medicine yourself. Surgery though, you really gotta do the internship residency route. You still don’t have to get boarded. But you will have to publish some bs paper and waste that time. Unless you are able to find a mentor to teach you privately.|I wonder whos results they are.|I’m surprised how many vets accept a position with negative accrual.  With how many clinics need vets this should be something that can be removed from the system.  Vets have more leverage than employers do right now and it likely will stay that way for a long time.|This is called negative accrual, this is not standard in all contracts.  If it is on yours I would suggest negotiating it out or taking a different position.  There are too many open positions around the country to accept negative accrual as a norm in pay structures.

Is the $120K the difference in the cost of schooling itself? I think you should think of the following:\\n\\n* Flights home to see family  / friends. Could cost at least $1K per trip minimum\\n* Cost of living (food, housing, etc.) will be a lot higher in England than Baton Rouge\\n* Does becoming a permanent resident or citizen of England mean anything to you? That could be a big positive for the England route\\n*  Investigate immigration status in England. Sometimes study permits don\\'t allow you to qualify for national health insurance scheme. Might be more $ for a private insurance plan or a school sponsored plan\\n\\nAnd many more nuances that come with international moving. With that said, only you can decide if it\\'s worth it.

A good one will pay decent but you’re not gonna be rich\\n- you will have to cut open dead rats, bunnies, and other and sometimes break their bones to make portions for raptors and scavengers\\n- depending on the animal, you can get hurt but if you’re doing ur job right it won’t be severe. Just bites/scratches. It’s only a problem with rabies vectors but idk any professional who’s gotten bit and you have to have the vaccine to be able to work with them\\n- some days ur gonna get gross, that’s what scrubs are for\\n- some animals will have parasites on their body and they will often crawl up your arm or you find them a few hours later bc they’re so little. It’s feather lice primarily bc ticks are usually attached and feather lice will fall off in a day or two bc we don’t have feathers but that is the main thing I do not like.

So having more knowledge of that work prior to your vet school experience will help you. It\\'s a small field and hard to break into. If you\\'re thinking capture and immobilization of let\\'s say bears for research a lot of that is done with PhD\\'s so maybe get in touch with a school that has a wildlife department and talk out best steps.

Took me three tries. I can’t tell u how brutal first and second year were because of anatomy and the lecture load. I felt the same. I would get a D and study harder only to get a C-. Once I realized this is not a test of intelligence, these vet school tests are a test of memory I stopped caring so much and just make it about memory. You have to find ways to memorize shit with mneumonjcs and stuf that your brain wants to remember. Just know it’s there to prepare you for the amount of BS you need to force urself to study for navle. It may have 0 use in the clinic but some people believe it all makes sense by graduation; The anatomy first year, then pathology second year, clinics 3rd year, and electives 4th year with some more clinics.  By the end it all makes sense together. Vet medicine is a monster. Idk where I’d start with teaching. I just wish we didn’t need to focus on all that large animal bs. Such a waste of time. Just with clinics, keep ur mouth shut and pretend ur dumb. Most residents and interns will see you as a challenge to their authority if you make recommendations better than them. Atleast in my experience.

It is an expensive journey and filled with insane amounts of stress. I wouldn’t have chosen anything else. But getting as much experience will greatly improve the stats you will get accepted to a vet school. You need very good grades and a very high class load to prove you can handle vet school.

Quote some stats of how frequently this occurs if the dog is not strictly exercise restricted after surgery.  It might be a bit passive-aggressive, but it’s one way of showing them it was not your fault. It’s a way of teaching the techs that 1) you do have the knowledge and 2) your tech might be more at fault for allowing too much activity too soon.\\nI often use my conversations with clients as an indirect way to teach my techs. I come from a ER/ICU background, and I do many things differently (and more “purist”) than the other docs at the GP where I work.|These happen from activity.

Well its not impossible but it\\'ll require some extra effort if ur looking  to do navle without vet prep... I personally studied initially by making my own notes from a no of sources.. i followed the list of diseases given by ICVA.. after 3 months of doing that i started preparing using Vetprep... since i practiced in a clinic aswell.. the clinical experience also helped.. but i could answer about 80% of those vetprep questions easily i could say.... So you can study for navle  without vetprep but its difficult.. and will require more time... and then there is a chance of not passing navle on the first try... so paying for vetprep is better than paying navle twice... I hope this helps..\\n Incase if youd need any help in ur preparation you can hit me up...|Kuru sneakers and compression socks.

For the lunging dogs, nope.|Was working about 60 hrs/week in ER/ICU when I decided it was now or never. I was CRAZY into my job, loved the intensity, the level of medicine, the focus on learning, and the great team I was a part of. But I was 33, knew I wanted more than one kid, and didn’t want to have kids when I was over forty. \\nAnd so it began - the shift from a full throttle ER/ICU vet, to a full throttle mom of five fantastic kids whom I ended up homeschooling for 9 years (7 years before Covid hit.). \\nIt began with a miscarriage during an overnight shift - fun times - then five babies in a span of 5.5 years (no twins.)\\nI went back to work after 3 months for the first and second, but worked weird hours (like 6 hour shifts) so that I would spend most of the days with them. After my fifth, I took a year off. \\nMy two oldest kids, now 21 and 20, were reminiscing recently about how sad they used to be when I went to work, because they felt like they wouldn’t see me again forever. \\nOne day I came home and found my oldest kid, about 7 at the time, missing an eyebrow. Dad - apparently my sixth child- had bet him $22 that he wouldn’t shave off an eyebrow. He did. Every time I worked, it seemed, stuff would happen.\\nOne day I was just leaning in to intubate an unconscious, cyanotic Pomeranian when I was paged. My husband was calling from the back of an ambulance, on the way to the hospital with my son who was gushing blood out his ear. (Backstory: Apparently he and his brother had been pretending to be dinosaurs by putting Q-tips in their ears, and jumping on the bed. Little guy fell on the bed, on the Q-tip, and of course it ruptured his ear drum and had to be surgically repaired with a graft. But I digress.)\\nAnyway, while leaning over that blue dog, chanting to my panicking self, “First save the dog. You can’t change the ambulance situation” was the moment I realized I just had to be home. \\nI took several years off except for a rare relief shift. When I started back, I had lost 99% of my confidence. It was awful and it was terrifying.\\nI’m 100% glad I was home with my kids while they were young but it’s almost a miracle that I had the guts to return.\\nIf I had it to do over, I guess I would have made it a point to do like one shift a month.\\nI started back by doing some vaccine clinics (shhh), then GP relief, then back to ER.  When my youngest got to high school age, I took on more shifts, but I still usually work shorter shifts (9-4, 4-11) because I want to be around for them. I do relief only so that I can schedule work around every one of their hockey games and saxophone performances. I refuse to miss ANYthing they do!\\nMy focus is 100% my kids. No longer my career. Don’t get me wrong - I’m super diligent and thorough with work when I work - but I work because it’s what I do with my time when my kids don’t need me. \\nHaving a baby will change your career, but there is nothing wrong with that. It doesn’t make it worse, just different. \\nGood luck!|I wrote a long reply to OP, but want to share my experience with you. I had 5 kids in 5.5 years, and never went back full time. I was (and am) all-in as a parent.\\nMy one regret is that I ended up taking a few years off while I was homeschooling four of my five (long before covid.)  Those homeschooling years were the absolute BEST, but to return to practice after that was terrifying because I had lost all confidence in my ability. If you do take time away, consider doing a relief shift once a month or so, just to keep that door open.|I hear ya on all that!  I would not mind if something I was passionate about that paid well landed in my lap! But I will say, being able to do relief work so that I can choose exactly when I want to work (“I can come in from 9-12, will that be helpful?”) has been a godsend. I am able to work enough to pay for everything they need, but still be around for them. \\nHaving kids close in age is awesome. Really really hard when they are little, but so much fun once they can all pee in the potty and buckle their own seatbelts!|Vegan pet food?

I’m in an area that has a serious shortage of emergency trained vets, so much so that there’s been a pivot to regular vets not doing emergency triage, and not being able to recognize emergencies. \\n\\nIs there a basic certification that’s available so that pet owners can know when it’s time for the ER?|[deleted]|[deleted]|I agree with some of the below threads. Pay varies from state and I’ve also found big cities tend to pay more than hospitals in burbs or rural areas. For instance, I’m not certified and as a tech in Boston, MA I make $27/hour but in Chicago, IL I made $23/hour. That being said, I live with my boyfriend and having dual incomes is honestly the only way I can afford to live.\\n\\nI know moving for a job is a big thing consider but maybe not a bad idea to see what’s out there. I’ve also learned to not be afraid to advocate for yourself. Tell these jobs with the low rates that you’ve gotten more competitive offers (how will they know if you’re lying??) and drive that price up. CVT are a hot commodity and the right hospital is willing to pay you for your expertist!|[deleted]|A new technician started a few months ago, and the way they treat her is awful, I’ve caught her crying out back in the kennel area. And I don’t think she’s doing a bad job at all. I’m getting sick of the toxic people.|Oh yeah there’s insubordination. I ask them to do something like ice incisions post-surgery and get a bunch of pushback. Because “no one else asks us to do this.” Every week I have to remind them and what seems like such a small, easy task gets attitude.|Nope! I never say anything to anyone about cases other vets have seen. I keep my mouth shut. I have seen some of my colleagues do that to each other, so I really keep to myself.|Haha I just hate confrontation. The kennel staff have told me that I am the nicest person in the whole building and have thanked me for giving them respect. I just don’t understand being nasty to someone else. I wonder what makes people act that way.|Stay the course and follow your dream. \\nPerhaps look into exotic/wildlife services you could volunteer with to see if this is a path you might want to specialise in?|[deleted]|[deleted]|[deleted]|Promising, but nothing is final until you’ve signed a contract.|Did you sign anything or have paperwork from your current job on the pay rise?|[deleted]|[deleted]|Ill keep that in mind, appreciate it!|Thanks for the tips and the heads up|[deleted]|[deleted]|[deleted]|[deleted]|This very interesting bc he runs the vet student hospital shadowing days- when you\\'re in ur first and second year, you get 4 days each year to shadow a 4th year vet student. Students were told they couldn\\'t leave by the faculty running each rotation, when apparently, the faculty know that we aren\\'t supposed to stay past 6pm. (Most rotations, we get there 7-8am, so we are having 10-11 hour days minimum.) Dr. C is the one who told us to absoutely tell faculty that we can leave at 6pm and it\\'s really sad to me that when he\\'s telling us to stand up for ourselves, that isn\\'t true for the resident programs. Such a bummer bc he\\'s always seemed so nice.\\n\\nIt gives the feeling of \"I struggled thru all this with my residency and did well so yall should too\"|[deleted]|i\\'m only speaking for the shadowing rotations we do as 1/2nd years anyways. i\\'ve worked with Dr. C for many handling labs and he\\'s always been kind! since his teaching role includes the shadowing program he was the one who told us to leave at 6pm when we shadow 4th years.|[deleted]|[deleted]|[deleted]|[deleted]|i\\'m emergency in california and get paid 21/hr. on that i still wouldnt be able to afford a place alone, would need 2-3 roomates and rent would be 30-40% of my income depending on if ur lucky for a good deal or not....|I\\'ve decided that I want to study vet science when after I graduate, but I hate that I\\'ll study something that I have near to zero knowledge about. Are there any textbooks that can provide a brief amount of knowledge about vet science? I\\'ve found some textbooks online but they all seem its for students who are going to specialize in something. Any help?|[deleted]|[deleted]|[deleted]|[deleted]|[deleted]|[removed]|[removed]|[deleted]|[deleted]|internships are almost always required and lately most people have had to do 2 :/. you need them for letters of rec from 4 other board certified specialists|Agree with this. More options is not always better. More options is more you don\\'t know and you\\'re trying to weed thru more surface level stuff (in my school you can only do 4 externships so no way you can figure out 10 different places!)|How old are you and is there any chance you can wait a year and apply to a state school? Just asking because the expenses to live on the island and travel in addition to tuition. It’s a great school though. Just the island life is expensive.|When you get your loans the first thing taken out, before your survival needs like food water and rent, is tuition. So out of the 20k or so you’re left with 5 k to survive on for an entire semester. You can use this to your discretion. I would not take out another loan for vet prep.|I used my unsubsidized loan for vetprep. I took out the max approved amount.|Wait. I’m talking about vet prep. It’s an online navle study system. Not anything with the school. It’s 700 bucks.|I had enough of my own savings to pay for everything other than tuition the first two years. My family paid for tuition the first half. The remainder of vet school I used federal unsubsidized loans. Whatever I was approved for I took out. I did not use any grad plus loans or private loans. My mother paid for my rent the last two years. I had 0 debt from undergrad|So total cost of having permission to be in the building and on the vet school roster was 240k with living expenses included. They didn’t teach me anything I didn’t know. I simply paid to become eligible for NAVLE and to be a glorified tech on their floor. I hated school.|Whoops. Oh I would never have do a program prior to vet school. Nothing can prepare you for the amount of bullshit they want you to know. It’s just memory games. You don’t learn anything until you start practicing.|I hated school. They worked us like slaves in the clinic. Then wasnt able to pass navle because of it. Once i had 5 months to study without working like a slave I was able to pass. I was not a fan of school by any means. I love the profession though outside of academia.|Please lemme know to if anyone can recommend any equine vet related stuff maybe ?|Even though they count for credits. You will still have to pay the same amount for the next semester. I maxed out my externship credits hoping I would lower my costs the next semester in lesser required electives. NOPE. paid 15k for 10 credits. Fing scam. Use the externships to check out where you wanna work. If you don’t like it…tell them you’re going onto an internship.|Love vet med. you can always be learning. You get the puzzles and challenges of medicine without dealing with humans full time. You can always learn more by opening a book and staying sharp. You can always be improving your practices. You can work wherever you want to work. It pays great if you work hard. Love it so much. So glad I just passed navle. Can’t wait to start my career.|I don’t let others borrow my instruments. If I do, I don’t leave the room till I get them back. Everything I have was given to me by a mentor or has been through hell with me.|I stuck with vet prep. Wasn’t till the third time, that I was out of school not being forced to work in the clinic 80 hours a week making salads for tortoises or soaps for doctors that I had time to actually sleep and study. Also go to a doctor and get ur blood and hormones checked. I found out I was low testosterone and it definitely helped me pass starting TRT. I put off going to the doctor for 6 years total because of vet school. Was just too busy. But vet prep. Try to do the questions in 1 hour blocks on the timed section and then take a 20 min break. Then go back and read all the explanations. If you don’t understand something. Then go to Merck and read about it. That’s what I did.|Focus on getting into vet school first. It’s extremely difficult. Then focus on passing the courses. The course load is nothing like you’ll ever experience in ur life. They force 8 years of education down ur throat in 4 years  and then demand you pass a 360 question test on rediculous veterinary knowledge before you can get ur license. While ur on clinics you will see if you like the internship/academia approach. Dont worry about specialties now. Focus on getting in and how the f you’re gonna pay for it.|The vet schools are atrocious what they are able to get away with in the US. JUST ABOUT 130k for in state tuition, or 220k for out of state. And that doesn’t include insurance, living expenses, etc.  Every grade is based on one multiple choice test and you have to read the class notes to pass so there’s No point in going to lecture. They force you to be a glorified technician in clinics and work absurd hours because there are no regulations on student labor. During corona they abused the fuck out of us. You just wear a white coat so everyone knows you’re paying to be a slave. Go to wherever is cheapest and study like hell for navle. My school didn’t prepare me for navle. I wish I went to Germany. They just force you to assimilate to their country. Which is reasonable imo. Just difficult while learning medicine and German culture.|Atleast on the timer section. Since the test is in April there is not much time to complete the timed and not timed sections.|If you are retaking in April. Really focus on practice questions. Especially timed ones. Then read the explanations. It covers the most material and removes the time wasted you will take making guided and study materials. I used vet prep. The third time I competed it to 97 percent. I passed test this time. Maybe use zuku. I also would read a little additional in material on the questions , whether I got wrong or right on Merck veterinary manual.|I viewed vet prep not as similar to navle, but as a fun way to learn the material. It was much better to learn and read through the question format than to just read random info all day. Challenging yourself to do well and get questions right was way more fun. What was annoying was reading all the explanations but it really reinforced the information about the species and random facts you may need to know or see.|I really want you to pass. Cause waiting till next November sucks so much. It’s what I had to do. Take as many vacation and sick days from school to study. I focused too much on not failing school cause I told myself I could retake the navle for 700 but if I mess up a semester I have to pay 30k plus living expenses for a year repeat.|Focus on the power pages and the powerlectures on questions you really don’t get. Like I had to rewatch pig diarrhea and respiratory diseases 10 times. Just to understand 5 percent of it. But I’m pretty sure I got a porcine coronavirus question right because of it.|would you be willing to share where/what company? or dm me? super interested in a place where i could rotate between small exotics and emergency/iurgent care!!|Code Fred|Never too late to do what you want to do. You are only on this earth once. Do what you want. Just know vet school is full of hormonal women who aren’t married that think education and a career will fill that hole. It was a miserable time for me as a man. I just kept my mouth shut as much as a could and went home immediately from school. Found the cool guys in the class to hang with. The residents were so fuckin miserable cause they get paid next to nothing and could’ve gone right out into private practice to make tons of money. Just know you need good grades and a tough class cload to prove to you handle the demands of vet school. It is designed so that you cannot work while being vet school. They spread 8 years of education over 4 years and you are taking a new class every few weeks while 4 other classes over lap and end at random times while new ones start. Clinics you need to work against your will and your opinion means nothing and will sometimes even bother the residents if you know more. They take it as a challenge to their authority rather than you caring about the patient and the medicine; because they’re mostly women. But I would do it again. I learned a lot about women and will probably never get married.|A lot of ERs do mentorship but you\\'ll need to ask around. \\n\\nIf you wanna dip ur toe- Modern Animal does some urgent care. I know they do both GP and urgent care so it\\'s a nice mix. No clue about pay logistics etc, but this is appealing for those who wanna do a mix. \\n\\nPersonally would not recommend an internship! Most ERs don\\'t care about it and have new grad type programs/mentorships that would service you faaaar better in terms of pay, experience, and overall progress. Internships where I am in California are like 70k for 80 hour weeks (including being on call nights, like maybe a week of PTO etc.). You\\'ll probably get really proficent at surgery and very comfortable, but at what cost? New grad vets at the emergency i work at (i\\'m a tech there, but a vet student as well) start at 125k as new grads. They have mentorship, a schedule for being comfortable/proficent with surgeries etc. You\\'ll get more than enough experience going straight into ER as a new grad role. I know they have something about a variety of different surgeries that needed to be signed off by a more senior doctor (watching a GI surgery, doing a GI surgery etc.)|Highly circumstance and location dependent.  You need a lawyer with experience in non-competes to answer these types of questions.  I would not make a potentially huge financial decision such as this based on what other redditors have experienced.|I hope someone sues the living hell out of this organization and that they lose the contract for this test for licensing. In no way is it any test of veterinary competence. It is merely only for hazing. Since the previous gen had to take it, so do we and it never changes. I have no idea how unclear questions of communication, seahorse euthanasia, and pig diarrhea have to do with me doing dentals, surgery, and physical exams every day. I had 0 questions on anesthesia, 1 on surgery. And veterinary schools are horrible as well. I never was able to, or taught to extract one tooth during my education. I merely paid to be a glorified technician in a white coat and to show up and be told all my thoughts are wrong because i had too much experience in private practice. Every test was multiple choice and tested no ability other than to regurg random garbage the professor thought were cool.|I am so sorry you didn’t pass. I had to take it three times. Passed by razor think margins this time but that all that matters. My advice. Complete vetprep. And the last month, I was only doing questions in 1 hour sections. Maybe 4-5 times a day. But I additionally read every answer explanation after too. I was able to quit my job and move home and study really hard. Beating this rediculous test is all about studying, training for the 7 hour grind, and hopefully getting a test with questions you know you can answer correctly.|Only 5 times. For a low price of 700 plus 500 for study materias|If failed again im getting my CDL and becoming a truck driver. Fuck it. Clearly my education was flawed and didn’t prepare me for what the ICVA deems as medically appropriate knowledge for practice. Like fish euthanasia, chicken feet pathology and llama reproduction.\\n\\n-I passed. I still don’t like the test. What a waste of time and money. And now I’m behind on my loans already.|Someone in my class got like a 750. I wanted to mri her brain. The ability to study against one’s will to that extent. Sheesh.|Always 425 and a roll of the dice that you got enough questions right. 3rd time taking this awful garbage pos test. Every year they find a way to make it nothing like vet prep and ask questions that are completely irrelevant.|In the real world. Cap the needle, separate the syringe and throw the needle away in the red bin and throw the syringe in the garbage to save on hazmat fees. They weigh the containers and bill. The test answer would be to throw the whole syringe in the red bin, don’t recap it.|To take a test that you’re either completely lucky you get questions you know or hopefully you get a score report from someone else that’s passing.|Yes get accommodations even if you don’t need the time for the questions. The extra time you get for breaks and to take the second half the next day sounded awesome. For me it didn’t help. Either I knew the answer or I didn’t. Really focus on the epidemiology. Those are freebies if you understand the specificity and sensitivity questions. I would try to complete vet prep and use the timed section the most. Use the non timed questions when you’re just relaxing but take time to do 1hour sections similar to the test. I can’t tell you how much it helped my stamina and to view the test as sections rather than individual questions. It also helps you make quicker decisions on questions you don’t know so you can focus on some questions you can reason out. Just such a bad test. They need to get rid of it.|They remove all the bad questions, after the test has been taken. How intelligent right? Rather than making sure the test has fair questions before it is taken…. Genius.|Focus on vet school first. It mostly degrades your will to want to stay in academia. It is extremely toxic. If anything, surgery alone is the best speciality because you learn how to fix things and too many vets in the field refuse to do surgery for 1 not having the time, two not being able to charge appropriately, and 3 they can make more money doing rooms. Internal medicine you can teach yourself. Also…the schools rely on radiology to do the ultrasounds where in private practice, if you want to get anything done as an internist, you need to learn how to ultrasound and interpret yourself. So I would get ur DVM. Work for a year. Then go do an ultrasonography course  where they teach you in a group how to scan. Then study internal medicine yourself. Surgery though, you really gotta do the internship residency route. You still don’t have to get boarded. But you will have to publish some bs paper and waste that time. Unless you are able to find a mentor to teach you privately.|I wonder whos results they are.|I’m surprised how many vets accept a position with negative accrual.  With how many clinics need vets this should be something that can be removed from the system.  Vets have more leverage than employers do right now and it likely will stay that way for a long time.|This is called negative accrual, this is not standard in all contracts.  If it is on yours I would suggest negotiating it out or taking a different position.  There are too many open positions around the country to accept negative accrual as a norm in pay structures.  You should be able to enjoy your vacation.|AVMA and WSVMA are the typical places jobs are posted in WA to my knowledge.  Some post in other locals but those are the standard places to post.|I mean what would really happen if you just left?\\xa0|Tips on getting these jobs without an mph?\\xa0|Yeah I avoided an internship because I figured I would put all the energy and stress the internship would demand of me in studying on my own time in private practice. They do not appear to be like they used to from the vets that inspired me to go to vet school. They graduated in the 80s. The internships and residencies appear to me to be more of working insane hours for insanely low pay. And then when ur done. Where are u supposed to practice at that level. There is a huge tech shortage and no clinics I know of with competent 24/7 care (south Florida).|There are a lot of great resources in learn.idexx.com the Idexx learning center if you can access that in India. A lot of continuing education on hematology.\\xa0|I currently use DaySmart (formerly Vetter) and I use multiple tabs all the time so that would be frustrating for me.  I am not enamored with daysmart, but I am not as unhappy as you sound w/Pulse.  I am thinking of merging with a practice that is currently on Pulse and was debating sticking w/Daysmart vs. swapping to their product.  Thanks|First off, I\\'m not a vet. Is the $120K the difference in the cost of schooling itself? I think you should think of the following:\\n\\n* Flights home to see family  / friends. Could cost at least $1K per trip minimum\\n* Cost of living (food, housing, etc.) will be a lot higher in England than Baton Rouge\\n* Does becoming a permanent resident or citizen of England mean anything to you? That could be a big positive for the England route\\n*  Investigate immigration status in England. Sometimes study permits don\\'t allow you to qualify for national health insurance scheme. Might be more $ for a private insurance plan or a school sponsored plan\\n\\nAnd many more nuances that come with international moving. With that said, only you can decide if it\\'s worth it. I find it sometimes helps to flip the question: If you were planning to go to England for vet school and someone said \"I\\'ll pay you $120K to go to LSU instead, all else being equal\", would you do it?|You are welcome!

Wildlife rehabilitation/rescue has become my life’s passion.\\n\\nCouple things you have to know\\n- you want to find GOOD rehab centers to learn from. Well funded and highly professional. Not one where nobody is monitoring volunteers and animals can get killed on accident from carelessness. It’s more than them having a good vet- it’s gotta be the way it’s run\\n- it is a very very high amount of euthanasia and that’s not for everybody. My brain sees it as a treatment for the untreatable and giving them respect/peace and am grateful for it. But I can’t do pet euthanasias emotionally 🤷🏼\\u200d♀️ everyone’s different\\n- it’s not rolling in money. A good one will pay decent but you’re not gonna be rich\\n- you will have to cut open dead rats, bunnies, and other and sometimes break their bones to make portions for raptors and scavengers\\n- depending on the animal, you can get hurt but if you’re doing ur job right it won’t be severe. Just bites/scratches. It’s only a problem with rabies vectors but idk any professional who’s gotten bit and you have to have the vaccine to be able to work with them\\n- some days ur gonna get gross, that’s what scrubs are for\\n- some animals will have parasites on their body and they will often crawl up your arm or you find them a few hours later bc they’re so little. It’s feather lice primarily bc ticks are usually attached and feather lice will fall off in a day or two bc we don’t have feathers but that is the main thing I do not like. Nobody told me and then I found some on my arm or leg and was like “where is this coming from”\\n\\nSome people can work in education for rehab centers that have resident animals that cannot be released into the wild. This is sometimes controversial but everywhere I’ve worked has had them|Wish I could say the same as a wildlife specialty 😅😅😭😭 but the joy I get is worth it|😂|You have SO much time. I completely switched my animal focus and my entire path. Some people go to vet school years after they graduate college. Go get a degree in animal science or zoology IMO. You’re gonna have to deal with mainly not working with animals everyday for undergrad unless you’re working- it will get you to your goal in the long run.|That’s what I wish I did instead of a directly vet focused undergrad.

Just my 2cents.|Best recommendation I can give you: find a veterinary job that isn’t working face to face with owners/clients. Changed my life|This is why we have a vet shortage! Pay for 4 years of vet school just to make 1/5 of a human doctor and be 3x more likely to unalive yourself? System has to change|Midline. Taught in poland, practiced in UK but noone said anything about me going flank|I think the people that do this generally do wildlife biology as undergraduate degrees and maybe get an additional master\\'s in wildlife biology first. You will not get ANY training on wildlife in vet school. Being a zoo/exotics/wildlife vet requires you to be a comparative biologist. Take what we know/have for domestics and apply to the species you\\'re working on. A lot of fact finding for papers to get protocols, etc... So having more knowledge of that work prior to your vet school experience will help you. It\\'s a small field and hard to break into. If you\\'re thinking capture and immobilization of let\\'s say bears for research a lot of that is done with PhD\\'s so maybe get in touch with a school that has a wildlife department and talk out best steps. If you\\'re thinking rehabilitation, then you\\'re typically doing that work on the side. If you\\'re thinking zoo then you\\'ll generally need a residency after vet school.|I work with wildlife so I don’t have to interact with owner ethics (thank god) but I remember in practice interviews in school they would give us situations like these and ask what we would do- very interesting discussion!|Just passed navle here. Took me three tries. I can’t tell u how brutal first and second year were because of anatomy and the lecture load. I felt the same. I would get a D and study harder only to get a C-. Once I realized this is not a test of intelligence, these vet school tests are a test of memory I stopped caring so much and just make it about memory. You have to find ways to memorize shit with mneumonjcs and stuf that your brain wants to remember. Just know it’s there to prepare you for the amount of BS you need to force urself to study for navle. It may have 0 use in the clinic but some people believe it all makes sense by graduation; The anatomy first year, then pathology second year, clinics 3rd year, and electives 4th year with some more clinics.  By the end it all makes sense together. Vet medicine is a monster. Idk where I’d start with teaching. I just wish we didn’t need to focus on all that large animal bs. Such a waste of time. Just with clinics, keep ur mouth shut and pretend ur dumb. Most residents and interns will see you as a challenge to their authority if you make recommendations better than them. Atleast in my experience. What I really really learned from vet school was where to look up information and how to back up what I wanted to do medically with sound medical reasoning.|Push you to ur limits of studying random information against ur will. Even Einstein said he found it pointless to memorize random facts you can look up in a book. Test was a huge waste of time I could’ve been helping patients and contributing to vet med.|During undergrad, I took a long leave of absence during which I worked at a veterinary clinic as vet assistant for 2 years.

And take the summers off. You’re gonna need it. You don’t need to be smart for vet school. You just need good memory and test taking skills. You do need to be intelligent to be a veterinarian. School was a joke tho. Everything was multiple choice. Not one written exam.|Cover as much as you can. But at UF it didn’t seem to matter. The boarded surgeon had a sleeve.   Pretty badass. They just better be sick tattoos. lol. Hopefully they’re not explicit or sexual.|Work in as many different vet clinics as possible. Make sure it’s really what you want to do. It is an expensive journey and filled with insane amounts of stress. I wouldn’t have chosen anything else. But getting as much experience will greatly improve the stats you will get accepted to a vet school. You need very good grades and a very high class load to prove you can handle vet school. Look at a schedule of a vet school to see how crazy it is too. You don’t get to pick much. You’re strapped in for the ride taking 5 classes at a time that would take all semester in undergrad but finish only in weeks in vet school.|Thank u!|Spend a week volunteering with the horses at Best Friends in Utah. They also might have internships available.|The two places I work, the techs always ask the docs if we need them to do anything else before they leave. The lead tech can certainly send them home early to avoid OT or whatever, but they still touch base with their docs before leaving.\\nIt’s not so much for permission, though - it’s just making sure the jobs are done.

Obviously it’s ideal to graduate and have this career as an option for a solid income with really flexible hours. I’m a parent of six, homeschooled my kids for 9 years, and have been able to be there for every hockey game, every Shakespeare performance, every riding lesson, every sleepover because I do relief work.\\nAs for things you don’t know and can’t remember? You will learn 90% of what you need to know in practice after you get out of school. The learning NEVER ends.\\nBut your kids. It breaks my heart to hear that your little kids have to be cared for by someone who is angry and scary and mad at them.  This can’t go on.  How can you find a way for your precious kids to be safe and happy, while you can finish school?  This is what you need to focus on.  I would start interviewing nannies or babysitters, and remember that it’s not forever…it’s to get you to the finish line (or really the starting line of opportunity) while keeping your kiddos safe and happy. Again, unpopular opinion here, but  for me personally? I would sacrifice absolutely everything if I didn’t trust that my little ones were safe - both emotionally and physically - while I was away.|OP said her husband and his short temper are a big part of the problem|Isn’t this really hard for you to track?|Agree. I know many disagree with me, but there is no way that our practice of medicine should be influenced by production incentive.|Oh that’s good. In my second job, we were salaried with no production incentive, but of course they tracked production. It was fun to compare, and interesting in that all of the ER docs had almost identical production. But then…they changed it so that we couldn’t see our production. \\nDown the line when they switched to base plus percentage, it became an issue.|Agree. #1 most important thing is that I can practice good, thorough medicine. Not possible with 15 min appointments.|The doctor asked me to put meds in a bag of fluids and I just stuck the needle through the side of the bag....|I’ve done that🤣|We had wall to wall stall mats. About every 2-3 months (as a tech at the time) I would pull them out and clean under them/disinfect both sides. Huge pain in the ass but it was econimical and worked. As a DVM I worked at the same clinic and was fine with the floors. In the stalls we had regular stall mats and they were sealed with a rubber caulk material (I had to reseal them once when I teched there). The other equine clinic I worked at had the same thing but in the year I worked there I never saw anyone pull them and clean underneath...god only knows what was growing under there. \\n\\nI have also seen the I would assume spray on grippy rubber stuff at the vet school but I don\\'t know cost wise what that would be.

They make a base $55k (if they are lucky) and our hospital just increases their production to 9%. They\\'re also all salaried so even if they pull a 100 hour week (which all my vets do!) They\\'re still only making 40 hour week pay. Our new grads are currently making $15/hr. It\\'s not work ethic that is going down. It\\'s businesses deciding vets shouldn\\'t be paid what they\\'re worth.|One of my veterinarians just had a very bad accident and needed multiple surgeries and was out for 2 months. When she got back the first thing our hospital said was \"you owe us $7500 for lost business, we\\'re taking it from your check\"\\n\\n She had to back out of an apartment that she was moving into because she couldn\\'t afford it now. She\\'s legitimately thinking of quitting the vet industry and working as a waitress because she \"made way more money with less stress\"|My friend just moved out of Texas because of the current political climate and said she would never go back, so not really gonna believe a stranger on the internet who can\\'t spell correctly. I also have relatives in Texas who are actively searching for a new place so they can move away as well.

And I\\'m (as well as many others are) not willing to move there on the chance that politicians there decide suddenly to become human beings with souls.|Apologies but I don\\'t feel comfortable saying where I live on the internet, but all hospitals in my state are roughly the same.|I work for a large emergency hospital. It sees small and large animals alike and we see wildlife as well. We have a doctor shortage because the company doesn\\'t want to pay us what we\\'re worth. We have doctors leaving vet med all together because they don\\'t want to pay us what we\\'re worth.|I am not a vet and I make more than our new vets do. I still don\\'t make much, but it\\'s more than them. And I will say that I live in an insanely high COL area. A studio apartment where I\\'m from can easily be $3k a month.|You have no clue what you\\'re talking about, my guy. They\\'re trying to find places that will pay them what they\\'re worth. Idk where you live but where I am that\\'s just not the case. I need you to open your eyes and see that not everyone lives in the same area you do and many people can\\'t afford to move across the country for a better paying job because they can barely afford to live where they are currently. \\n\\nMy doctors love being veterinarians. They are not leaving out of ignorance, they\\'re leaving because they cannot afford to live and pay off their loans with what is being offered. Or they\\'re offing themselves but that\\'s also tied into not being appreciated and paid what they\\'re worth. My doctors stay at the hospital for days at a time, sleeping/showering/eating here to care for their patients. They get paid their 40 hours a week but are here 100 hours a week, they\\'re not clocking out at 4pm, which you so condescendingly have decided they must be. Get off your high horse, my god|Thank you so much! It’s actually heartbreaking but I’ll try to find a way through it!|They say I had an obligation too as under the university guidelines. The support services wrote a letter to tell them what had happened and they said because of my OT assessment in early July that means none of that applies and I should have been able to study. Yeah because mental health is THAT stable. I don’t think there’s any winning with them. I brought up the equality act on my appeal because my ot officer said I would likely be covered under it. But they don’t care|Do you know if this counts for long term mental illness eg anorexia and diagnosed anxiety depression? x|I’m in the U.K. The OT report says its covered under the equality act. It’s a long term thing. But I didn’t want to take medical Leave because I thought it would be resolved within 2 weeks.|Going forward, make a point to tell clients, in front of your techs, the potential complications of not restricting activity - like hematomas. Quote some stats of how frequently this occurs if the dog is not strictly exercise restricted after surgery.  It might be a bit passive-aggressive, but it’s one way of showing them it was not your fault. It’s a way of teaching the techs that 1) you do have the knowledge and 2) your tech might be more at fault for allowing too much activity too soon.\\nI often use my conversations with clients as an indirect way to teach my techs. I come from a ER/ICU background, and I do many things differently (and more “purist”) than the other docs at the GP where I work.|These happen from activity.

This makes me a bit more sure of what im doing!|Have you tried a prep program?|Hey there... Well its not impossible but it\\'ll require some extra effort if ur looking  to do navle without vet prep... I personally studied initially by making my own notes from a no of sources.. i followed the list of diseases given by ICVA.. after 3 months of doing that i started preparing using Vetprep... since i practiced in a clinic aswell.. the clinical experience also helped.. but i could answer about 80% of those vetprep questions easily i could say.... So you can study for navle  without vetprep but its difficult.. and will require more time... and then there is a chance of not passing navle on the first try... so paying for vetprep is better than paying navle twice... I hope this helps..\\n Incase if youd need any help in ur preparation you can hit me up...|Kuru sneakers and compression socks.

For the lunging dogs, nope.|Was working about 60 hrs/week in ER/ICU when I decided it was now or never. I was CRAZY into my job, loved the intensity, the level of medicine, the focus on learning, and the great team I was a part of. But I was 33, knew I wanted more than one kid, and didn’t want to have kids when I was over forty. \\nAnd so it began - the shift from a full throttle ER/ICU vet, to a full throttle mom of five fantastic kids whom I ended up homeschooling for 9 years (7 years before Covid hit.). \\nIt began with a miscarriage during an overnight shift - fun times - then five babies in a span of 5.5 years (no twins.)\\nI went back to work after 3 months for the first and second, but worked weird hours (like 6 hour shifts) so that I would spend most of the days with them. After my fifth, I took a year off. \\nMy two oldest kids, now 21 and 20, were reminiscing recently about how sad they used to be when I went to work, because they felt like they wouldn’t see me again forever. \\nOne day I came home and found my oldest kid, about 7 at the time, missing an eyebrow. Dad - apparently my sixth child- had bet him $22 that he wouldn’t shave off an eyebrow. He did. Every time I worked, it seemed, stuff would happen.\\nOne day I was just leaning in to intubate an unconscious, cyanotic Pomeranian when I was paged. My husband was calling from the back of an ambulance, on the way to the hospital with my son who was gushing blood out his ear. (Backstory: Apparently he and his brother had been pretending to be dinosaurs by putting Q-tips in their ears, and jumping on the bed. Little guy fell on the bed, on the Q-tip, and of course it ruptured his ear drum and had to be surgically repaired with a graft. But I digress.)\\nAnyway, while leaning over that blue dog, chanting to my panicking self, “First save the dog. You can’t change the ambulance situation” was the moment I realized I just had to be home. \\nI took several years off except for a rare relief shift. When I started back, I had lost 99% of my confidence. It was awful and it was terrifying.\\nI’m 100% glad I was home with my kids while they were young but it’s almost a miracle that I had the guts to return.\\nIf I had it to do over, I guess I would have made it a point to do like one shift a month.\\nI started back by doing some vaccine clinics (shhh), then GP relief, then back to ER.  When my youngest got to high school age, I took on more shifts, but I still usually work shorter shifts (9-4, 4-11) because I want to be around for them. I do relief only so that I can schedule work around every one of their hockey games and saxophone performances. I refuse to miss ANYthing they do!\\nMy focus is 100% my kids. No longer my career. Don’t get me wrong - I’m super diligent and thorough with work when I work - but I work because it’s what I do with my time when my kids don’t need me. \\nHaving a baby will change your career, but there is nothing wrong with that. It doesn’t make it worse, just different. \\nGood luck!|I wrote a long reply to OP, but want to share my experience with you. I had 5 kids in 5.5 years, and never went back full time. I was (and am) all-in as a parent.\\nMy one regret is that I ended up taking a few years off while I was homeschooling four of my five (long before covid.)  Those homeschooling years were the absolute BEST, but to return to practice after that was terrifying because I had lost all confidence in my ability. If you do take time away, consider doing a relief shift once a month or so, just to keep that door open.|I hear ya on all that!  I would not mind if something I was passionate about that paid well landed in my lap! But I will say, being able to do relief work so that I can choose exactly when I want to work (“I can come in from 9-12, will that be helpful?”) has been a godsend. I am able to work enough to pay for everything they need, but still be around for them. \\nHaving kids close in age is awesome. Really really hard when they are little, but so much fun once they can all pee in the potty and buckle their own seatbelts!|Vegan pet food?

I am excited about this project too. I am happy to see their [collaboration with Storj](https://mysterium.network/blog/mysterium-and-storj-labs-join-forces/). I am still reviewing their whitepaper and comparing it to the Orchid Protocol. If any one has any cliff's notes I'd appreciate it :). I am interested in using VPNs for increased DAPP security (DDoS attacks). ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/mrg7bb/just_bought_my_first_myst_tokens_and_feel/guo6ytu/ | My first observation is that Mysterium highlights the intention of splitting up packets to traverse different paths along the VPN network which protects a user from a malicious node. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/mrg7bb/just_bought_my_first_myst_tokens_and_feel/guy06xo/ | You can buy on Polygon using Quickswap if you can cheaply get funds onto Polygon. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/n4omws/buying_mysterium_crypto/gwx8g85/\n",

      "Wow so i fixed it guys. I deleted the DNS in my Wi-Fi settings and after a new one was generated I hit apply. Then all of the sudden I was back online! My question is what in the world caused that to happen? I love Mysterium but feel very sketched out, yet idk if it was even their fault. What do you guys think? I’m skeptical of reinstalling it again. I had a some MYST in my account prior to uninstalling, I doubt I would get it back if I reinstalled right? Not the end of the world, I’m just happy to be online again although I missed a lot of meetings this morning. Really curious how this happened after enabling the kill switch, quitting and uninstalling. Lmk what you think. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xx6kgk/need_help_ever_since_i_enabled_kill_switch_i_cant/iraks5t/ | Feels like I’ve won the lottery.

Now I'm really not touching this project. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/twpgt1/psa_moderators_are_censoring_posts_on/i3kenty/ | Okay good to know, I jumped on a Russian node and started thinking twice lol. You think it’s safer going with residential nodes or no difference? 🥂 ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tsbqed/security/i2wtq00/ | YES. Any more of a liability compared to something like ExpressVPN or any other popular centralized vpn? Given the nature of both i feel like it would be more prevalent with dVPNs but really don’t know ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tsbqed/security/i2wu0ju/ | Wow! Yeah seems the returns with Mysterium aren't great, I would have to enable whitelisting as well. Helium is a cool project. I wanted to buy a miner and antenna but all of the miners were sold out with a 6 month waiting period. I talked to this guy who does free installs but takes like 80% of the rewards which seemed pointless. Monero mining I don't know anything about. I don't have a mining rig either, just an iMac but I have no issue buying the equipment if the returns are steady ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tijvgl/best_ways_to_earn_supplemental_income_aside_from/i1ervof/ |  Yeah I think I am. Do you have any tips? I would be considered a noob but have good internet speeds and hardware. What kind of returns do you get? What are your thoughts on enabling whitelisting? Is it worthy the drop in MYST? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/thwllq/mysterium_vs_orchid/i1cbhz0/ | Lol fair enough. Hows the returns with presearch? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/thwllq/mysterium_vs_orchid/i1cvidl/ | Yeah it's bad. What's up with that? I hope they're at least working on something. They have no presence at all it's creepy. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/thwllq/mysterium_vs_orchid/i2nxv92/ | What type of returns do you see?
