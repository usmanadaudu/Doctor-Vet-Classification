queerofengland,Contrary to employers belief at will does not actually mean you can be fired for any reason with no consequences It may be worth contacting a lawyer for your case and see if you have any grounds | This And now shes an easy scapegoat because they fired her | I wish I had better advice for you but Im sure youve heard all of the basics like setting a routine going to bed earlier etc Hang in there | Well thats a bit rude There are plenty of people who manage to have healthy routine and outside lives while going through med Why is it wrong to ask for advice to balance your mental health and livestyle under a heavy workload and why does it upset you | So you think people shouldnt ask for advice to make things better for themselves They should just ignore their issues bottle it up expect it all goes away I can see that method has made you a healthy and positive person Please choose to be quiet next time rather than make things worse for someone looking for help We dont need it You arent helping | Please stop You have no background in mental health and no scientific basis for the things youre saying Im sure you think youre doing something here but youre not You can and will make things worse for a struggling person | You should also apply to any schools that you are considered instate for If you dont have a vet school in your state there is probably one that has a contract with your state for instate acceptance and tuition | I love when were able to solve the problem I feel like with animals and probably human medicine too tbh theres so much we dont know cant find the problem theres nothing we can fix lets try some meds and see etc And its really satisfying when we can actually send the patient home with a diagnosis and effective treatment plan | In the US both a PhD and a medical doctorate including DVM are considered doctorates I cant speak for the distinctions of other countries | Honest question what happens to the pets then In the US it would probably end up in an overcrowded shelter where it or another pet gets put down anyway to make room How does Germany handle this What criteria do they use to decide euthanasia is justified | Euthanasia is not the hard part the lack of euthanasia is imo Euthanasia is peaceful and not a bad ending at all The conditions pet owners force their pets to live in because theyre unwilling to let them go or manage their needs correctly however thats the hard part Also imo less popular opinion theres really no such thing as convenience euthanasia when we have such an overpopulation of pets problem If a pet is otherwise healthy and could go to a new home many owners are willing to surrender to a rescue if you offer to reach out for them But when the alternative is going to an overcrowded shelter where them coming in means another animal getting pts is that really saving anything Idk I come from the large animal rescue world where the lines for quality of life are drawn much differently and the barrier for entry for rescuing is much higher than small animals but I wish the small animal communities would discuss euthanasia more practically than they often do | Interesting I wish that worked here | Yeah that behavior is unacceptable It would be one thing for them to be hesitant until you got more experience but being openly disparaging is not okay Vets are in far too short supply for them to be acting that way Talk to your boss first and if nothing improves Im sure a better clinic would be happy to take you | I would finish the program if youre close but dont continue the career if you hate it Take the degree and do something else with it Having that degree will help you get other jobs or get into different programs Just because youve put this much time in doesnt mean you have to keep putting time in I was halfway through masters in biology for ecology research when covid hit and I got hella burnout with academia and research altogether I dragged myself through the degree then applied it differently and went into data analysis instead and now applying it toward vet school lmao | It would only potentially stop you from getting the grades you need to get in but wont likely affect you doing well in vet schoolYou could also go the vet tech route if the clinical stuff is what you enjoy Vets dont often get to do much of that | Shadow a clinic and find out if exposure helps I personally grew up around farm medicine so fluids and gore never got me but I had to watch a handful of spay Similarly when I did my undergrad in biology there would always be a few students who had to walk out of the first dissection lab for a bit but by the end of the semester it was just another day Most everyone gets over squeamishness pretty quickly but there can always be something that comes up that youre not used to Just the other day a cat came in to the ER with an amputation incision popped open and its insides making their way to the outside even the seasoned techs gagged at the one | Question about how clinic hours are verified by VMCASI have taken a pretty curvy road to get where Im applying to vet school this year so Im about years post high school where I did about hours of vet clinic shadowing between two small town mixed animal clinics Ive called both of them and they said they dont have records that far back for volunteer hours and its been almost years so Im sure the vets dont remember me personally after only a week of shadowing each full days for a full week at each clinic Im wondering if I can even count hours from that long ago and if so how does the VMCAS verify clinic hours Would they call the vet for verification or need something signed I expect both would be willing to if I sent them my documentation from the original shadowing experience Im just not sure what to expect TIA | I feel this way about every nondog Even cats get the short end of the stick comparatively imo,Other
theophania808,Ive worked in the vet industry for years and almost everyone had tattoos Im covered with tattoos and never had a problem only with VCA If you ever apply there I recommend you dont they suck they have a tattoo policy,Veterinarian
paxbanana0,Those are long probably stressful days at work You probably use up all your energy there and have nothing left over Can you plan to take a day or week off Even using sick time to rest and recharge may be worthwhile I also recommend labwork just to be safe if you can afford it | I can only speak for my clinic as a GP I always do all of the above The most important first step is making sure the ER can take my patient I hate sitting in hold for minutes with the ER the hold music is the worst But it has to be done | I worked straight today I feel like we have remained pretty busy with intermittent days that arent as slammed Seems like were making as much if not more than last year this time too | My worst experience was with a human dentist I recommended a dental with likely extractions for his old small breed dog with Perio and he told me that its ridiculous to recommend extractions for teeth with just recession I told him Id never even imagine telling my human dentist how to practice medicine gave him the information for a veterinary dentist in the area and declined to schedule just a teeth cleaning Id say mostly I dont have issues with clients in the human medical field though | Id be looking for another job ASAP Talk to your boss cite specific examples of hostility Start documenting stuff on the day to day so you can tell them exactly whats happening and when If nothing changes leave You may find a better job offer in the process | No Income based repayment makes it manageable but your payment is based upon your income You have to recertify yearly As of now you will owe income tax on the amount forgiven So thats years of a mortgage payments that will not touch principal and realize average cost of living makes zero difference on the payment amount with a huge tax burden at the end If you feel highly motivated to pursue vet med at least have a plan in place explore the best repayment plan and deduct everything you can to reduce your AGI | It depends on the hospital Ive worked for Banfield for years and Im able to practice medicine as I wish I enjoy my work and think we provide good medicine and surgery for our patients The benefits are good the pay is good and you have more options to move up in administrative positions if you want that kind of thing Therere a lot of safety nets and backup because its corporate Work place injury covering for ER overnight because of a rare complication etc Banfield makes it fairly straightforward My private practice experience was abysmal in comparison | Financially no If youd asked me two years ago Id say hell no in all ways But Im in a good spot now I make pretty good money I can work extra days easily for good pay and Im never ever bored at work I work with a great nontoxic team too The stress is manageable now too But the first three years were hell the first year out was all suicide ideation Its a tough profession and vet school doesnt prepare you at all for the reality financially or emotionally | If I didnt laugh Id cry,Medical Doctor
Most-Exit-5507,In high school I found a youtube channel called Vet Ranch that showed a lot of interesting surgeries and procedures I kind of forced myself to watch the surgeries to get desensitized lol but eventually I stopped flinching and getting squeamish Also I learnt that I get grossed out more from human surgeries rather than animal surgeries maybe cuz I imagine it happening to me idk,Other
3_Black_Cats,In phoenix we are offering our new grads prosal k with and a k signing bonus With no negative accruals Just food for thought | You can always try Worst they say is no | I would focus on dog cat horse and bovine questions Have a high percentage of correct answers in these for vetprep Maybe swine Know your weaknesses example if its pharm really study MOAs etc Know common diseases testing modalities treatments for these species Dont stress about the other species they make up such a small percentage of the exam that they should not be stressed about and an educated guess is good enough Also agree using the ICVA practice test Its formatted like the real thing and gets you a good idea about passing,Veterinarian
Frizzyawkward,Im a soon to be veteran looking to get into vet school Ill be doing all my prereqs at UTK and hoping for the best when I apply Any tips for getting volunteer hours I had a bunch in high school about years ago now through my schools veterinary assistance program but I have no contact with anyone that would verify that Besides maybe the classes on my highschool transcripts I wouldnt really have proof Ive been active duty these years and I know Im seriously behind other candidates but dont want to give up Any tips in general for a late starter,Other
matcha-fiend,vet assistant making target workers make more than me I dont even have time to try to finish school with how stressed I am to pay the bills feels so futile sometimes,Other
ARatNamedClydeBarrow,As a VA this makes me so sad for you Yeah it takes you guys some time to hit your stride but thats the same for everyone I would never dream of speaking to a DVM that way Voicing concerns in a respectful manner and having a discussion is one thing but to talk to you with such derision is absolutely not okay Its far past time for a chat with their supervisor head doc PMI love my new grad doctors so much They always like to talk things out with me I love hearing the trains of thought and even sometimes ask my opinion if its not something theyre super familiar with but is something Ive seen before They love to teach us things they learned in school it helps solidify concepts for them and we probably get to learn something new Im losing one of my new grads and Im super broken up about it I switched my dog to her when she started and now he doesnt have a vetSome advice for emergencies even if youre not comfortable taking the lead if youre not occupied doing other things then try to get involved and make yourself useful for CPR scenarios offer to count or breathe if youre comfortable with it restraint for IVC placement getting hot or cold packs as needed grabbing supplies for a u cath pulling out emergency drugs etc This way you can observe what the more experienced DVM on the case is doing without hovering too much or getting in the way biggest thing here though is to know when to ask questions and when to shut up dont go into a full differential while the main doc is trying to interpret rads for example you most likely will get yelled at lol My newest new grad likes to be a fetus tech his words and help out for little things if he has the time and tries to be helpful during emergencies if hes available because he feels it makes him a better doctor | I learned this extremely quickly when I started working ER I now carry this phrase like a shield and I have to frequently remind my poor new grad DVMs in GP to remember this because I see how much it hurts them when the clients dont want to listen,Medical Doctor
Shemoose,Vet tech since the same and Im on euro a hr | I sent this to mu cop friend,Other
agirlwhowaited,As someone whos worked as an assistant I would NEVER call a vet by their first name unless they had specifically asked me to You worked hard for your title and deserve respect if you are giving it to them Ive unfortunately worked with a lot of knowitall colleagues who think they know more than seasoned vets most of us see right through it but it doesnt make them any easier to work with | Yes this is a good point I dont think any students have graduated from the full program yet so Im curious if theyre on track to finish their PhD in years | Thank you And yes doing the PhD with residency would be a back up plan doing the dual degree is preferable for me with the tuition waver as an OOS | I havent been accepted to vet school yet Still waiting to hear But Id be happy to chat with you about why I want to go this route Congrats on your acceptance | The website actually details that the PhD portion is three years But that just seems SO fast | I am not a veterinarian vet tech in the process of applying to vet school but Ive worked with lab animals for several years and perform the euthanasias myself It can be hard and I struggled initially but eventually you learn how to cope Fortunately Ive seen enough positive research results that help to justify the practice and foster an appreciation for the necessity of animal models There are still the occasional cases that get to me and I think it is healthy to allow yourself to feel these losses to a certain degree as you dont want to become entirely desensitized We all came into the career because we love animals its natural to feel distress at times learning healthy coping mechanisms is essential The animals are always under anesthesia or sedated prior so in most situations the experience is not traumatic for the animal It is also helpful to have supportive staff I know this isnt always common in vet med but it is truly helpful when there is collaboration and attention to compassion fatigue | In four years youll still be four years older so might as well pursue what you want to do Im almost and havent been accepted into vet school yet but still trying | Im on my third cycle with a less than stellar GPA and have yet to get accepted anywhere I have hours in various different vet fields including research experience and publications My advice to you since youre living at home would be to work to improve GPA Im in the process of taking post bac classes to improve GPA and it is taking a really long time with how competitive vet school has gotten I dont think my experiences will ever outweigh someone with moderate experience but higher gpa It may but is unlikely There are other fields you can pursue to make more money and still stay within the realm rather than working as an assistant in GP Depending on what your degree is in you could do pharmaceuticals research lab animal You could also leave the field entirely so you can make more money and use your free time to volunteer,Other
Difficult_Ad_8152,If you enjoy it definitely give it a go Vet med is difficult and has its ups and downs try to hold on to the things that bring u up | Tell them youll Leave the clinic if youre not treated with respect and find a good one that treats you with respect if they dont change you didnt spend so much of your life becoming a vet to be treated poorly or to quit because of one shit clinic youre more resilient than that cause u were capable of getting through vet school,Other
Best_Bid_9327,Im getting this too | They just told one of the accounts was compromised They told to not click in any links | Get rid of windows,Other
Cheeztitts,I have the same irrational fear and I applied for vet school so its totally doable Dont let fear control you since its going to be very unlikely well run into a rabid animal Im still unvaccinated but Ill probably get the rabies vaccine and do yearly titers so that I have peace of mind My vet said she still has valid rabies titers even after years after her first vaccine pretty crazy Im glad I found someone else with the same experience as me | What are some small animal zoonotic diseases That way I can properly protect myself Thanks,Other
Environmental-Snow29,I had a retired surgeon admit to me he accidentally killed his daughters hamster trying to remove a mass with lidocaine and nothing else My sister is a nurse who worked one of the surgical units at johns hopkins She reported to me that the surgeons regularly complained about vet costs and freely admit they dont take their dogs for anything unless they have to and try to treat at home I have limited respect for certain humam medicine people | I second Ross I loved my experience on the island Its just very overpriced Clinics was at LSU i hated it All i can say is thank god ross sent like of us rossies during my semester Couldnt have made it through LSU without them I liked the farm animal team and exotics team at LSU Equine and internal med made me want to throw myself into the missisippi and consume the oleander they have on the campus ER LSU peeps were great too I will say i did appreciate that they made sure we had adequate rest during my anesthesia rotation which other schools didnt seem to do from what i heard from class mates | Nope you are right Davis has a bit of a poor rep om the vet side as far as culture def a few ppl with god complexes because its UC davis | Vet here i would say practice is almost uniformly better than acedemia I think clinics at my school were almost unhelpful Who can retain anything if they live in abject fear I was suicidal really suicidal and im still dealing with that to this dayalmost years after good days and bad days Im am tired of hearing this Vet med is already hard I almost want to just call up the heads of the schools and just yell at them If youre a rossie report back to ross about this experience Maybe they will stop sending students to this school Its not the first time I have heard this about purdue Im just gutsy enough to write a strongly worded email right now just because your post hit my sore spot Maybe someone can start a petition to examine culture on changeorg IDKbut i feel like we are turning into just another healthcare field where everyone eats their young No I refuse If nothing changes the best i can say is be the change you wanna be Be good to your underlings when you are a fully fledged vet | And i will add when i was at clinics I had a resident absolutely destroy me for discharges she was the straw that broke the camels backterrible to internsactually stated that interns shouldnt be handling advanced cases like you are supposed to be teaching them you crazy resident When i say she made me feel incompetent I mean it Guess what Im like actually a pretty good vet And I mostly enjoy my job Everyone gets their right rewards in the end | We expect that from clients it should not be coming from our mentors and teachers period One should expect a certain lvl of professionalism from proffesionals | What about SAVMA The student cet association if any one one is to be a year old senator now is the time to advocate for an issue | I think you are so optimistic to think that we have that much effect I would absolutely up and leave because of reproductive rights Pregnancy is and you can lose your job or hours or money And as some of us are breadwinners if i cant abort an unintentional pregnancy i would be screwed This is not a pick you up by the boot straps thing Or if its a medical issue texas has made some odd choices I agree its a great offer if everything were true but ill stick with my k job is NOVA with great school systems higher taxes and reproductive rights And omg so many international food options | You mean people are asking for what they are worth in the face of a changing world and economy Inconceivable | And LGBTQIA friedlier Texas is like another countryit may as well beif NOVA changes i doubt it will i would find a place that fits | Oh you sweet summer child you think consensual unprotected sex is the only way unintentional pregnancies happen | Dude its just a stateno one cares since the days of thelma and louisetexas has had a rep And youre so cute to think this information is just on TVAnd yeah i can just leave but a lot of women in texas cantso its also a solidarity thing Either way you do you stay in texas Fight the good fight Im too old stagnant and have too much to lose and i think others are in that position Dont go insulting everyones work ethic and lack of gumption Also its not just repro immigration talk from the governor of texas is worrisome too My point is that there are LOTS of reasons people are resitent when it comes to Texas So many | Oh honey you make it too easy I think everyone is questioning yours | Seeeee Point made My immigrant colleagues wont go to Texas either Its sad because k is actually good | Pop an SSRI Now you just gave yourself away I doubt a real vet would say that or anyone that works in a clinic Maybe some sort of investor your reddit is a giveawayAnd oh godcryptolol | Hahahahahahahahahaha Okay Mr reason and Logic I bet you are SUPER used to being questioned on a daily basis An expert | Customers I knew it Not one of us Dont pretend to know what vets or their techs go through Based on your own logic you have no place to question why people would actively choose not to live in Texas | Me thinks thou dost protest too much I dont think anyone would want to work with someone so patronizing But please keep typing im happy to repost Maybe thats why youre so hurt people arent fans of the political climate in Texas especially with insignificant politics concerning abortion and whatnot Women are just too stubborn and scared as you put it monolith that we are | I didnt want to be piggeonholded into some human medicine specialty I wanted to be able to do medicine but also surgery It was the variety of medicine you get to practice as a vet There is also kinda a path to business but thats something thats harder to do with the rise of corporate vet med,Veterinarian

almostdonestudent,I was a tech on and off for years I would never dream of talking to a vet like that Unfortunately Ive worked in some toxic clinics and it sounds like you found one I would go to the higher ups and I would can the technicians out when they say rude things They arent your boss youre the doctor,Veterinarian
qwertyculous,Quizlet was my best friend I was on that thing all the time Vague terms like canine respiratory will get you things course numbers will get you past or current student sets VMED I hardly ever made my own study guides I was just a vulture for other peoples It might not be on the test youre taking if its some guy from Ohios material but if youre confused about a concept someones probably written it in a better way Also youtube videos on like arrythmias and stuff Theres always going to be quacks on the internet acting like theyve been to school but actual accomplished people also make videos Youll have to sort through the bullshit to actually find good videos but scooting marketing and ego garbage to the side for science is basically half of being a licensed vet,Veterinarian
i-touched-morrissey,You might try something else as a career When you get out into the real world things might get stressful My mental health was shit when I was in vet school only I thought everyone was as stressed out as I was I didnt get help until my dad committed suicide when I suspected that there was something wrong with me As a practicing vet now I obsess about what people think what I said I worry that if I cant fix something that I suck and no one will want to come see me again Some days I wish I was a kindergarten teacher but then I would worry about pissing off someones parents I always wanted to be a pathologist but never made it further than vet school but it is ideal for an introvert who doesnt feel comfortable speaking to people | I have been in practice for years and there are definitely times when I wish I was something else Interacting with people is the most difficult part of my job and a lot of us vets are highachieving sensitive people who get down on ourselves when something goes awry I live in a small town and the gossip and backstabbing on social media can be heartbreaking and depressing As far as being financially stable it took me about years to pay back my student loans I worked for a doctor who expected me to drop everything if someone called after hours was passiveaggressive and paid on commission so my first years were difficult Now that I am a practice owner things are better but still stressful in different ways I have a nephew who is in college to apply to vet school and hes smart and his family is wealthy so he wont be burdened with the horrible debt after school If you are financially endowed it will make your life better after graduation | Im a solo doc in rural Kansas and I have been sitting around in the afternoons for the last few days I will have people from the big city come occasionally because they are booked out for weeks How that happens I will never know | Way back in during my senior year we had bullying senior clinicians I was pregnant during my large animal rotation and had HORRIBLE headaches and nausea and one of my clinicians said that I was lazy and spent too much time in the conference room with my head on the table Most of the other large animal clinicians were very supportive offered congratulations were nice people except this guy We also had a really awful equine surgeon He embodied the definition of being a total dick If you were in the in crowd he was a blast but if you were someone like me who hated every second I was in the equine you better watch out The interns were not much better The residents were OK I think they were as stressed as the senior students We had seniors and interns having affairs and interns and clinicians having affairs I suppose everywhere in academia its like this Dont they make TV dramas about medical students having to deal with asshole doctors in hospital situations | Im so old I have no idea what a Nerdbook is | Do you have access to Crumbl Cookies | I have kids who are adults I did surgery took radiographs whatever the day called for with no special precautions | I graduated from Kansas State University in and we had clinicians who buddied around with popular senior students and those of us who were academically outstanding and didnt know about brown nosing fell behind I was th but since I wasnt one of the popular kids and didnt hang out with the clinicians my standing slipped Every once in a while we would hear what the clinicians thought of us when a popular student would let us know what was going on If you think school is full of backstabbers and mean cliquedout techs you are definitely not prepared for the real world And wait until clients turn on you when something goes wrong And your boss turns on you when your clients complain You are just here trying to help an animal feel better and there are people doing Pink Floyd The Wall jeering and mockery and making you feel stupid for ever entertaining the thought of doing something good in the world | I sit for eye surgery Sometimes for PU sx | Do you have access to previous tests Thats how e we did it back in the s | I had our local shelter in my kennels for about years I thought it was extremely depressing and frustrating because people are stupid and thoughtless about their pets We had county workers bring in litters of puppies dumped out in the country with a bag of dog food we had a litter of kittens duct taped in a shoe box found in our park I could go on and on Horrible disgusting things people do to animals is shameful But that also makes it rewarding knowing that YOU can do something for these animals that they will have a warm place to sleep with food water medical treatments if needed and possibly a new home We are a nokill shelter As far as the veterinary part most shelters have limited funds for vet expenses so you have to get used to being very selective in what you get to do for sick animals or injured animals There really is no typical day unless you extablish certain hours for intake surgeries or examining existing shelter animals My day as a solo practice doc starts with surgery in the morning but a dog fight emergency or someone dropping off a vomiting cat can throw a monkey wrench into the schedule I think shelter medicine will make you feel happy about those animals you can rehome but knowing how horrible people can be to animals is something that not everyone can process without being disturbed | Do you have access to previous tests They were valuable to us when studying for exams and to see what the instructors thought was important enough to test us on | Tangent here on hereditary problems Why do we forbid breeding dogs with umbilical hernias but dont dissuade people who breed dogs with bad skin | DVM here I have tattoos of my parents writing on my arm where people see it all the time My receptionist has tats all over her No one cares anymore | I use metro a lot for diarrhea and will confirm that it resolves diarrhea | Cat neuters ALWAYS get suture ligatures usually gut Dog neuters up until a Reddit post a while back I did open castrations with gut ligatures on pretty much everything Now if I neuter a puppy with a tiny or nonexistent scrotum I do a scrotal neuter which was suggested to me a couple years ago by a RedditorSpays I just ligate circumferential with gut times on most pedicles and on fat dogs big dogs pyos in heat I will do ligatures of transfixation layers to close abdomen PDS | Im an oldtimer graduated in I like how gut kind of sticks to itself when it gets a little blood on it No slipping like PDS or Vicryl I did have to repair a hernia that a cow vet put in a dog abdominal closure What do you do if you dont spay dogs I do this daily | It warms my heart to see that someone else uses the verb anal glanded | It means that you had a dog | I can understand isolating a parvo dog in a little room my iso is pretty small too But if its the room where clean towels and drapes come out of that will come into contact with puppies thats not a good idea I worked for for AAHA hospitals and both of them reused autoclaved syringes I saw several abscesses from that practice | We had tests every week on Tuesday and Friday mornings Every single week for years Final week wasnt a major stressor because we were already accustomed to taking tests all the time | If they decline tests thats on them You put that in the medical record right And spays bleed We all know that | When I was in vet school a gift card for groceries would have been

Popular_Hour6343,I didnt know Someone randomly mentioned vet school in convo and I never considered it until then after st year of undergrad I decided to job shadow that summer months and get a feel for it Looking back I wasnt really exposed to a whole lot but generally I enjoyed my time job shadowing I pursued vet school got in started and thats where i really started to ask myself if this is what I want to do I started to wonder if I can actually do this if Im cut out for it if Im actually going to be able to enjoy it because its one thing to watch a vet work but a whole other thing to be the vet working Anyways I just went with the flow of things hoping that I can do it and I would enjoy it and when i got to my clinical year thats when I knew A big part of the doubt was having confidence to do the things that vets do and basically the more exposure and practice I got the more my confidence built and the more I was able to enjoy the work | No youre not Im from Canada and went to Melbourne for vet school my grades werent good enough for the schools in Canada and the states Its not selling yourself short its just being realistic about your opportunities for success Look at Australia not sure how tuition compares to island schools but with the conversion it was cheaper than the states Check out oztrekk | Recently graduated from unimelb most of my classmates the ones that shared their salaries earn between k One of my friends found a job in Sydney at a private clinic smallies offering k Dont sell yourself short If I were still there I wouldnt accept an offer less than Ideally | Yeah fair point Whichever clinic I chose would depend on salary support mentorship hours distance and etc If all the other factors are ideal I wouldnt mind a lower salary but depends how low Disposable income is really important to me especially around this range The minimum Id expect is mainly for me to live some what comfortably So honestly Id try to find another offer if it was k regardless of the other factors And yeah there is pressure to produce but even at k you should be able to produce x times that if its a well managed clinic especially if youre keen to do surgeries and dentals | Im a new grad from Canada about to write my navle soon but tbh I dont even look at jobs that dont post a salary if I get desperate then maybe | I job shadowed for the first time when I was and I didnt take any notes Now I dont remember anything from my job shadowing experience except for the overall feelings of the experience which I think should be the focus so early in your schoolingIf youre consistently involved with a vet through the years youll naturally learn a lot through repetition without having to write anything down You still have the rest of highschool years of undergrad and then years of vet school I wouldnt bother taking any notes now I think most vets would understand that That being said take a note pad and if youre interested in something make a note and look it up at home Have fun jobshadowing | One of my friends got her results on NEB | The fact that I wasnt really inspired by anything else I thought about medicine but despite the fat salary the long difficult journey didnt seem worth it to me Vet med combined the best of both worlds for me allowing me to practice medicine and work with animals Compared to a medical doctor there were less hurdles to become a vet,Other
Think_Not_Doer,Yassss Queen | Yea I am excited about this project too I am happy to see their collaboration with Storj I am still reviewing their whitepaper and comparing it to the Orchid Protocol If any one has any cliffs notes Id appreciate it I am interested in using VPNs for increased DAPP security DDoS attacks | My first observation is that Mysterium highlights the intention of splitting up packets to traverse different paths along the VPN network which protects a user from a malicious node | You can buy on Polygon using Quickswap if you can cheaply get funds onto Polygon,Other
Personal-Escape4283,Got it But why can I only select or worth of MYST Seems pretty strange imo Why cant we just send however much we like Is there a way to just see our address and send whatever amount we choose | Youre a legend bro Wonder why tf they dont make this accessible seems like a no brainer | Same problem here WTF | UPDATEWow so i fixed it guys I deleted the DNS in my WiFi settings and after a new one was generated I hit apply Then all of the sudden I was back online My question is what in the world caused that to happen I love Mysterium but feel very sketched out yet idk if it was even their fault What do you guys think Im skeptical of reinstalling it again I had a some MYST in my account prior to uninstalling I doubt I would get it back if I reinstalled right Not the end of the world Im just happy to be online again although I missed a lot of meetings this morning Really curious how this happened after enabling the kill switch quitting and uninstalling Lmk what you think | Feels like Ive won the lottery Now back to my minimum wage misery | I did no reply and its been a week | Wow thats so sketchy wtf Now Im really not touching this project | Okay good to know I jumped on a Russian node and started thinking twice lol You think its safer going with residential nodes or no difference | YES Any more of a liability compared to something like ExpressVPN or any other popular centralized vpn Given the nature of both i feel like it would be more prevalent with dVPNs but really dont know | Wow Yeah seems the returns with Mysterium arent great I would have to enable whitelisting as well Helium is a cool project I wanted to buy a miner and antenna but all of the miners were sold out with a month waiting period I talked to this guy who does free installs but takes like of the rewards which seemed pointless Monero mining I dont know anything about I dont have a mining rig either just an iMac but I have no issue buying the equipment if the returns are steady | Yeah I think I am Do you have any tips I would be considered a noob but have good internet speeds and hardware What kind of returns do you get What are your thoughts on enabling whitelisting Is it worthy the drop in MYST | Lol fair enough Hows the returns with presearch | Yeah its bad Whats up with that I hope theyre at least working on something They have no presence at all its creepy | What type of returns do you see Do you have whitelisting enabled,Other

alexiskef,What are you guys planning to do marketing wise How are you planning to raise awareness about Mysterium | Obvious scam However I would guess that Mysterium users are surely on a techicall level more than capable of seeing through such bullshit and NOT providing their Private Key or mnemonic phraseSCAM,Other

erlingspaulsen,Nice If anyone is hosting a Mysterium node and have a spare hard disk its very easy to run a Storj node alongside Mysterium I do this on my Raspberry Pi | My Raspberry Pi is running the Mysterium Rasbian image Then I just followed the Storj installation guide and installed Docker engine downloaded their Docker image and started the Storj storage node inside its own container I just looked up Presearch and it looks like you can run their node through a Docker container so this should be okay to do alongside Mysterium To install the Docker engine on Rasbian you can follow this guideinstallusingtheconveniencescriptThanks for bringing it up as I was not aware of this project Might as well try this myself | Doesnt look like Presearch node is supported on Raspberry Pi yet Hardware Specification Docker image is only for x x based CPUs for now We plan to support ARM Raspberry Pi in the future but were currently focused on fixing bugs and making sure the current platform is robust before additional supported platforms | Thats not an issue Im in the same boat as you started out with the Mystberry image from Mysterium then I installed the Docker engine on top of that So Storj is just running inside its own Docker container kind of like a virtual machine inside the Raspberry PI while the myst service and OpenVPN is running outside Docker on the Mystberry OS itself It has been running a couple of months now without any issuesIm also trying to install an NKN node on the Raspberry PI now not using a Docker image but on the OS itself Trying to get the most out of that little thing haha | Correct SSH into your Raspberry Pi as the myst user and then switch to root user with sudo su You can then install the Docker engine as root | Havent really found any other projects where I can run a node on Raspberry Pi yetBy running Myst Storj and NKN my Pi is using around CPU and memory with a CPU C Seems like NKN is using most resources out of the three,Other
--solaris--,I think a lot of other people made some good points so Im not going to repeat a lot of it Its never too late to consider vet med as a career and undergrad is a great opportunity to push yourself and make yourself competitiveI will play devils advocate though I am a second year resident and Im burnt out already Undergrad is years vet school is another and residency is If you want to do aquatic medicine then it will likely be another years of rotating and specialty internships before residency Thats upwards of years of training ahead of you Vet Med can be rewarding but it is hard and long to get to the end of your training Im not saying this to discourage you but simply to make sure you know what you would be commuting to You have to be driven and always keep your eye on the prize Be prepared for long nights long weeks and long years | As someone who knows people looking for path jobs in diagnostics this information is not current Most diagnostic centers have placed a hold on hiring and industry has definitely slowed down Also pharma almost always requires a concurrent PhD | Some of these comments are absolutely insane and just speak to how toxic the culture is in vet med For most of you stop cherry picking what OP said in the post If the technician is calling the other doctors by their last name it is active disrespect As a technician I would never have disrespected a doctor like that As a doctor now I would expect the same respect as my other colleagues I go by my first name because thats how I like it but as someone who was once a technician the appropriate thing to do is to call them by their last name For those of you saying that respect is earned OP earned that shit by completing years of schooling to get their degree for some of us Did they know everything coming out No None of us do Most of us understand that and are welcome to constructive advice which I think its clear that OP is What should not be acceptable is the nitpicking and hazing that is often given to new grads There is a way to respectfully give advice If you are a technician OR a doctor this is a useful skill to learn Technicians know things doctors dont know and doctors dont know things technicians know Instead of belittling each other they should create an environment where people are open to ask questions and share advice,Other
100realtx,If you like the industry but dont care for the pay an employee in a clinic makes you can always look at industry roles IdexxzoetisHeskapetdesk there are thousands of veterinary companies out there that offer better pay and allow you to still be in the field Although not in practice | There is a lower the dose campaign from idexx You can find it on the website I am sure They also sell the only digital radiology system that requires half the radiation dose than that of a traditional system Pretty cool technology maybe your clinic is willing to check it out | Yall wild Ill let yall continue to swirl around this toilet bowl of a discussion Sorry to derail your question op The pile of shit being left here isnt getting you anywhere closer to finding a worthwhile associate And to the clown that deleted their postsforeshame Internet is full of unworthy trolls and youve proven one | Bless all your hearts This isnt a difficult game to figure out Yall seem to be too dense to look for a viable solution that involves compromises Only dvms I know that are unhappy are corporate dvms that have to abide by the corp bullshit that anyone has a dislike for You aint happy where you at then fix it Quit complying This poor clinic just askin about how to find a vet now has to weed thru all this bullshit for no real answer other than find a non lgbtqia male dvm Otherwise it seems like a headache | It is disappointing to feel like the work ethic of this industry has declined over the last years years ago new grads could expect base k with about production Now they are getting k production with much better benefits and work life balance Not to mention the sign on bonus that corporate groups are giving the new grads All tides turn in time I think youve got a hell of an offer regardless of what the states reproductive rights are | Touch | When the commenters here merely state TEXAS Fuck texas and their anti feminist anti gay bullshit Clearly thats someone watching too much news and not living day to day here Op didnt even mention extended benefits and everyone slammed it as its a texas problem Its not a texas problem Obviously its a workforce problem when the women are too scared or stubborn or both to come to a place that will pay them fairly As op stated a pretty fair wage as far as Im considered and still not knowing exact details | Never once did I say pull anything up by any bootstraps Yall putting words in my mouth And vary rarely is an abortion life threatening To wait a week or less to travel to an area that allows it isnt difficult Please stay wherever you are and advocate whatever you want This tribalism of red vs blue is only compounding this and many other issues | If you cant abort an unwanted pregnancy shouldnt you be taking the act of unprotected sex into consideration as well Dont want a baby Theres ways to prevent it to begin with | You can always travel for repro rights Not a difficult concept And most Texans dont give a shit what you identify as as long as you dont push your shit on us who cares what you do Turn the tv off and have some conversations with people The difference isnt a wide gap and we tend to agree on most things Yall too worried about what msnbc or fox as to say about it Their are not our puppet or yours Quit acting like it And yeah I do believe the system can change Ive seen it happen Ive lived the change To discount a place because of international food You have clearly never experienced the vast culinary melting pot of many texas cities Too stuck in your own existence to experience what different places have to offer Keep yourself where you are its your mindset that keeps shit stagnant | I question your intelligence in the face of your advanced degree Learn the industry and you may surprise yourself Fucking clowns | Supply and demand affect these rates the most Start hurting for vets the wages go up Also the type of medicine they practice matter Small animal vs large animal ecg | Soooo if years ago the going rate for a new grad was k and now most places I deal with are offering k its not quite double but pretty darn close Seems like pay is keeping up with most things Again you dont like your current situation there are others to be had There is just a lack of doing so for whatever reason you want to point out I most commonly see what I see | To say politics is the reason they cant hire anyone is flat bullshit that only the weak and simple minded allow them to let it affect them like that | I would question her place of employment instead of the state she lived in Thats dumb | I wouldnt require someone to do something with their body they didnt want to Its not my decision And if the govt says its a must well time to adapt right I personally wouldnt fire someone because they chose to or not to get something thats voluntary I helped my people look for alternatives to vaccination Medical Flat saying no thanks no poke for me I let my people choose Honestly great point Maybe we will implement some sort of compensation for women in my org that need to travel to get the medical care they require I could even implement it for the opposite of women that need help getting pregnant Looky here something positive from this shit storm | Lol obviously not But if I found myself in that situation Ive got bigger fish to fry than an unwanted pregnancy If thats your true worry maybe you should reassess your surroundingspossibly a state that allows open carry of a firearm might deter any unsavory types that could lead to said unwanted pregnancies | Okurrr Just look at movement maps during Covid One of the most blue states California had more residents move from there to texas Jesus yall need to pop another ssri and chill How do you think those drugs yall are on for such a hard life yall have had affect a fetus | Never said I wanted them to that it was justified that they made that Its much different now especially in my area of texas the average salary is k plus production for even a new grad | My reason and logic seem to confuse even the most basic of individuals My intelligence should a always be questioned As should yours If we are not flexing the gray matter on a daily basis we are but withering away | Thats ignorant to leave the industry because your not getting paid what you are worth Find a place that will pay They are everywhere Of the plus vet clinics in my part of the world are looking for a dvm and will pay K incentives Open your eyes Either that or these drs leaving want to work with a hour lunch and months pto Oh and only want vaccine appointments because they arent comfortable in sx or more difficult cases Thats the lack of gumption I speak of | No one said to take out student loans I know dvms that floated their schooling and I know ones that did take loans out and paid it off in years because they busted ass The way some of these commenters are talking they be living at the clinic so what mortgage Joking dont downvote me more Sure things are more expensive I get that everyone feels that bite But if your wages in the profession are up you should still just as easily meet those obligations just as the dvms of years ago did Im no math expert but I can do that math | As the saying goes scared money dont make money Its like saying I wont work in Houston because of greenspoint Well why not Conroe instead Might as well not go to New York either since we ship both the immigrants and our stray dog population there Oh no the migrant flow continuesssssss | Its only hostile to them because they let it be Ok my state says I can or cant do something doesnt mean I have to abide by that I bet you never speed do you Thats the state telling you what you can and cant do with your body too isnt it A bit oversimplified but the same concept Yall too worried about red vs blue or they vs them You do you boo but please stay the fuck away from this state and its wonderful people Theres a saying for a reason dont California my Texas The anger and downvotes Ive gotten in this thread is hilarious All the while I just laugh continue about my day I bet yall going home and crying to your spouse about the unhinged asshole on Reddit Cry into your pillow no one cares | Idk if you read my last comment I literally just said I would like to look into compensation for women that require or want such care Its not their fault texas has this issue and they shouldnt suffer no one should because of it Im not denying anything If anything Im looking to facilitate their choiceeven would like to go as far as helping the women whom want to become pregnant that cant I fail to see your issue here | Please read above I stated I helped my people find alternatives Religious and medical exemptions I fail to see the issue | Daily I welcome it If I dont challenge my customers and they dont challenge me its a boring life Hell if I dont challenge myself how boring Ill be the first to admit when Im wrong as well Hence how Ive made it to where I am in life and in this industry Just because I dont have some advanced degree from some prestigious institution doesnt mean I lack in intelligence Ive given my life to this industry just as many veterinarians have Im not so pretentious that I cant see the Forrest for the trees This answer is simple Your undervalued and overworked GO SOMEWHERE ELSE The clinic you work at isnt the only one its not your only option Not in Texas not in Idaho No matter where you are or want to be there are many options for yourself You just have to take the initiative rely on yourself no one else | If you cant afford to live and work where you currently are and feel undervalued I would imagine doubling your base salary and increasing your other benefits would entice you to make the move across the country No high horse just the reality of where I am at Im not happy where Im at or getting paid what Im worth Im actively looking for a place I will be satisfied Simple as that And maybe they would off themselves if they realized that was an opportunity | I know paid it off within years All of them in the last years How did they pay it off within years of graduation you ask By busting their ass and living below their means Taking extra shifts at other hospitals Hell one of them worked in industry worked overnight ec and lived like they were in college still It can happen It does happen Funny thing is we can circle back to work ethic and gumption Those that choose to pay their loans off over the long haul typically lack some of those two qualities Or extenuating circumstances create issues paying off loans that fast The power of simple math fired the ass busters up and they made it happen for themselves | Yes customers I spent years in practice In every role As a industry consultant I speak with customer vet clinics all over the country I advise them to stay away from and to not hire clown acts like yourself Just because I currently reside here doesnt mean my view point would be different if I lived somewhere else Like when I lived in California for years Still a consultant in the industry I directed my customer clients what have you on how to best run their business Staying away from problem or toxic employees is at the top of the list If you are a veterinarian I feel terrible for your clients and your business Maybe its not suffering now but a room full of toxic bullshit always boils over | I havent screamed once And considering Ive had to weather all types of economic storms Im pretty well versed on it Also thanks for assuming the adversities I have faced in life But if you must know my back story heres a snippet Grew up poor busted my ass to put myself thru school and worked tirelessly for an industry I love and have literally almost died for Yet Im still here fighting the good fight Politics be damned | I would check diagnostic and distribution companies Theres all types of remote dvm roles Something like idexx telehealth or corporate veterinary groups Not sure if any of those are in Germany but its worth a shot,Veterinarian
