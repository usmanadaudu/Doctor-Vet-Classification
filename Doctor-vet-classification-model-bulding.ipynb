       "'Contrary to employers belief at will does not actually mean you can be fired for any reason with no consequences It may be worth contacting a lawyer for your case and see if you have any grounds | This And now shes an easy scapegoat because they fired her | I wish I had better advice for you but Im sure youve heard all of the basics like setting a routine going to bed earlier etc Hang in there | Well thats a bit rude There are plenty of people who manage to have healthy routine and outside lives while going through med Why is it wrong to ask for advice to balance your mental health and livestyle under a heavy workload and why does it upset you | So you think people shouldnt ask for advice to make things better for themselves They should just ignore their issues bottle it up expect it all goes away I can see that method has made you a healthy and positive person Please choose to be quiet next time rather than make things worse for someone looking for help We dont need it You arent helping | Please stop You have no background in mental health and no scientific basis for the things youre saying Im sure you think youre doing something here but youre not You can and will make things worse for a struggling person | You should also apply to any schools that you are considered instate for If you dont have a vet school in your state there is probably one that has a contract with your state for instate acceptance and tuition | I love when were able to solve the problem I feel like with animals and probably human medicine too tbh theres so much we dont know cant find the problem theres nothing we can fix lets try some meds and see etc And its really satisfying when we can actually send the patient home with a diagnosis and effective treatment plan | In the US both a PhD and a medical doctorate including DVM are considered doctorates I cant speak for the distinctions of other countries | Honest question what happens to the pets then In the US it would probably end up in an overcrowded shelter where it or another pet gets put down anyway to make room How does Germany handle this What criteria do they use to decide euthanasia is justified | Euthanasia is not the hard part the lack of euthanasia is imo Euthanasia is peaceful and not a bad ending at all The conditions pet owners force their pets to live in because theyre unwilling to let them go or manage their needs correctly however thats the hard part Also imo less popular opinion theres really no such thing as convenience euthanasia when we have such an overpopulation of pets problem If a pet is otherwise healthy and could go to a new home many owners are willing to surrender to a rescue if you offer to reach out for them But when the alternative is going to an overcrowded shelter where them coming in means another animal getting pts is that really saving anything Idk I come from the large animal rescue world where the lines for quality of life are drawn much differently and the barrier for entry for rescuing is much higher than small animals but I wish the small animal communities would discuss euthanasia more practically than they often do | Interesting I wish that worked here | Yeah that behavior is unacceptable It would be one thing for them to be hesitant until you got more experience but being openly disparaging is not okay Vets are in far too short supply for them to be acting that way Talk to your boss first and if nothing improves Im sure a better clinic would be happy to take you | I would finish the program if youre close but dont continue the career if you hate it Take the degree and do something else with it Having that degree will help you get other jobs or get into different programs Just because youve put this much time in doesnt mean you have to keep putting time in I was halfway through masters in biology for ecology research when covid hit and I got hella burnout with academia and research altogether I dragged myself through the degree then applied it differently and went into data analysis instead and now applying it toward vet school lmao | It would only potentially stop you from getting the grades you need to get in but wont likely affect you doing well in vet schoolYou could also go the vet tech route if the clinical stuff is what you enjoy Vets dont often get to do much of that | Shadow a clinic and find out if exposure helps I personally grew up around farm medicine so fluids and gore never got me but I had to watch a handful of spay Similarly when I did my undergrad in biology there would always be a few students who had to walk out of the first dissection lab for a bit but by the end of the semester it was just another day Most everyone gets over squeamishness pretty quickly but there can always be something that comes up that youre not used to Just the other day a cat came in to the ER with an amputation incision popped open and its insides making their way to the outside even the seasoned techs gagged at the one | Question about how clinic hours are verified by VMCASI have taken a pretty curvy road to get where Im applying to vet school this year so Im about years post high school where I did about hours of vet clinic shadowing between two small town mixed animal clinics Ive called both of them and they said they dont have records that far back for volunteer hours and its been almost years so Im sure the vets dont remember me personally after only a week of shadowing each full days for a full week at each clinic Im wondering if I can even count hours from that long ago and if so how does the VMCAS verify clinic hours Would they call the vet for verification or need something signed I expect both would be willing to if I sent them my documentation from the original shadowing experience Im just not sure what to expect TIA | I feel this way about every nondog Even cats get the short end of the stick comparatively imo'"

Pay varies from state and I’ve also found big cities tend to pay more than hospitals in burbs or rural areas. For instance, I’m not certified and as a tech in Boston, MA I make $27/hour but in Chicago, IL I made $23/hour.

I never say anything to anyone about cases other vets have seen. I keep my mouth shut. I have seen some of my colleagues do that to each other, so I really keep to myself.|Haha I just hate confrontation.

Students were told they couldn't leave by the faculty running each rotation, when apparently, the faculty know that we aren't supposed to stay past 6pm. (Most rotations, we get there 7-8am, so we are having 10-11 hour days minimum.) Dr. C is the one who told us to absoutely tell faculty that we can leave at 6pm and it's really sad to me that when he's telling us to stand up for ourselves, that isn't true for the resident programs.

Just asking because the expenses to live on the island and travel in addition to tuition. It’s a great school though. Just the island life is expensive.|When you get your loans the first thing taken out, before your survival needs like food water and rent, is tuition. So out of the 20k or so you’re left with 5 k to survive on for an entire semester. You can use this to your discretion. I would not take out another loan for vet prep.|I used my unsubsidized loan for vetprep. I took out the max approved amount.|Wait. I’m talking about vet prep. It’s an online navle study system. Not anything with the school. It’s 700 bucks.|I had enough of my own savings to pay for everything other than tuition the first two years. My family paid for tuition the first half. The remainder of vet school I used federal unsubsidized loans. Whatever I was approved for I took out. I did not use any grad plus loans or private loans. My mother paid for my rent the last two years. I had 0 debt from undergrad|So total cost of having permission to be in the building and on the vet school roster was 240k with living expenses included. They didn’t teach me anything I didn’t know. I simply paid to become eligible for NAVLE and to be a glorified tech on their floor. I hated school.|Whoops. Oh I would never have do a program prior to vet school. Nothing can prepare you for the amount of bullshit they want you to know. It’s just memory games. You don’t learn anything until you start practicing.|I hated school. They worked us like slaves in the clinic. Then wasnt able to pass navle because of it. Once i had 5 months to study without working like a slave I was able to pass. I was not a fan of school by any means. I love the profession though outside of academia.|Please lemme know to if anyone can recommend any equine vet related stuff maybe ?|Even though they count for credits. You will still have to pay the same amount for the next semester. I maxed out my externship credits hoping I would lower my costs the next semester in lesser required electives. NOPE. paid 15k for 10 credits. Fing scam. Use the externships to check out where you wanna work. If you don’t like it…tell them you’re going onto an internship.|Love vet med. you can always be learning. You get the puzzles and challenges of medicine without dealing with humans full time. You can always learn more by opening a book and staying sharp. You can always be improving your practices. You can work wherever you want to work. It pays great if you work hard. Love it so much. So glad I just passed navle. Can’t wait to start my career.|I don’t let others borrow my instruments. If I do, I don’t leave the room till I get them back. Everything I have was given to me by a mentor or has been through hell with me.|I stuck with vet prep. Wasn’t till the third time, that I was out of school not being forced to work in the clinic 80 hours a week making salads for tortoises or soaps for doctors that I had time to actually sleep and study. Also go to a doctor and get ur blood and hormones checked. I found out I was low testosterone and it definitely helped me pass starting TRT. I put off going to the doctor for 6 years total because of vet school. Was just too busy. But vet prep. Try to do the questions in 1 hour blocks on the timed section and then take a 20 min break. Then go back and read all the explanations. If you don’t understand something. Then go to Merck and read about it. That’s what I did.|Focus on getting into vet school first. It’s extremely difficult. Then focus on passing the courses. The course load is nothing like you’ll ever experience in ur life. They force 8 years of education down ur throat in 4 years  and then demand you pass a 360 question test on rediculous veterinary knowledge before you can get ur license. While ur on clinics you will see if you like the internship/academia approach. Dont worry about specialties now. Focus on getting in and how the f you’re gonna pay for it.|The vet schools are atrocious what they are able to get away with in the US. JUST ABOUT 130k for in state tuition, or 220k for out of state. And that doesn’t include insurance, living expenses, etc.  Every grade is based on one multiple choice test and you have to read the class notes to pass so there’s No point in going to lecture. They force you to be a glorified technician in clinics and work absurd hours because there are no regulations on student labor. During corona they abused the fuck out of us. You just wear a white coat so everyone knows you’re paying to be a slave. Go to wherever is cheapest and study like hell for navle. My school didn’t prepare me for navle. I wish I went to Germany. They just force you to assimilate to their country. Which is reasonable imo. Just difficult while learning medicine and German culture.|Atleast on the timer section. Since the test is in April there is not much time to complete the timed and not timed sections.|If you are retaking in April. Really focus on practice questions. Especially timed ones. Then read the explanations. It covers the most material and removes the time wasted you will take making guided and study materials. I used vet prep. The third time I competed it to 97 percent. I passed test this time. Maybe use zuku. I also would read a little additional in material on the questions , whether I got wrong or right on Merck veterinary manual.|I viewed vet prep not as similar to navle, but as a fun way to learn the material. It was much better to learn and read through the question format than to just read random info all day. Challenging yourself to do well and get questions right was way more fun. What was annoying was reading all the explanations but it really reinforced the information about the species and random facts you may need to know or see.|I really want you to pass. Cause waiting till next November sucks so much. It’s what I had to do. Take as many vacation and sick days from school to study. I focused too much on not failing school cause I told myself I could retake the navle for 700 but if I mess up a semester I have to pay 30k plus living expenses for a year repeat.|Focus on the power pages and the powerlectures on questions you really don’t get. Like I had to rewatch pig diarrhea and respiratory diseases 10 times. Just to understand 5 percent of it. But I’m pretty sure I got a porcine coronavirus question right because of it.|would you be willing to share where/what company? or dm me? super interested in a place where i could rotate between small exotics and emergency/iurgent care!!|Code Fred|Never too late to do what you want to do. You are only on this earth once. Do what you want. Just know vet school is full of hormonal women who aren’t married that think education and a career will fill that hole. It was a miserable time for me as a man. I just kept my mouth shut as much as a could and went home immediately from school. Found the cool guys in the class to hang with. The residents were so fuckin miserable cause they get paid next to nothing and could’ve gone right out into private practice to make tons of money. Just know you need good grades and a tough class cload to prove to you handle the demands of vet school. It is designed so that you cannot work while being vet school. They spread 8 years of education over 4 years and you are taking a new class every few weeks while 4 other classes over lap and end at random times while new ones start. Clinics you need to work against your will and your opinion means nothing and will sometimes even bother the residents if you know more. They take it as a challenge to their authority rather than you caring about the patient and the medicine; because they’re mostly women. But I would do it again. I learned a lot about women and will probably never get married.|A lot of ERs do mentorship but you'll need to ask around. \n",

      "Personally would not recommend an internship! Most ERs don't care about it and have new grad type programs/mentorships that would service you faaaar better in terms of pay, experience, and overall progress. Internships where I am in California are like 70k for 80 hour weeks (including being on call nights, like maybe a week of PTO etc.). You'll probably get really proficent at surgery and very comfortable, but at what cost? New grad vets at the emergency i work at (i'm a tech there, but a vet student as well) start at 125k as new grads. They have mentorship, a schedule for being comfortable/proficent with surgeries etc. You'll get more than enough experience going straight into ER as a new grad role. I know they have something about a variety of different surgeries that needed to be signed off by a more senior doctor (watching a GI surgery, doing a GI surgery etc.)|Highly circumstance and location dependent.  You need a lawyer with experience in non-competes to answer these types of questions.  I would not make a potentially huge financial decision such as this based on what other redditors have experienced.|I hope someone sues the living hell out of this organization and that they lose the contract for this test for licensing. In no way is it any test of veterinary competence. It is merely only for hazing. Since the previous gen had to take it, so do we and it never changes. I have no idea how unclear questions of communication, seahorse euthanasia, and pig diarrhea have to do with me doing dentals, surgery, and physical exams every day. I had 0 questions on anesthesia, 1 on surgery. And veterinary schools are horrible as well. I never was able to, or taught to extract one tooth during my education. I merely paid to be a glorified technician in a white coat and to show up and be told all my thoughts are wrong because i had too much experience in private practice. Every test was multiple choice and tested no ability other than to regurg random garbage the professor thought were cool.|I am so sorry you didn’t pass. I had to take it three times. Passed by razor think margins this time but that all that matters. My advice. Complete vetprep. And the last month, I was only doing questions in 1 hour sections. Maybe 4-5 times a day. But I additionally read every answer explanation after too. I was able to quit my job and move home and study really hard. Beating this rediculous test is all about studying, training for the 7 hour grind, and hopefully getting a test with questions you know you can answer correctly.|Only 5 times.

The extra time you get for breaks and to take the second half the next day sounded awesome. For me it didn’t help. Either I knew the answer or I didn’t. Really focus on the epidemiology. Those are freebies if you understand the specificity and sensitivity questions. I would try to complete vet prep and use the timed section the most. Use the non timed questions when you’re just relaxing but take time to do 1hour sections similar to the test. I can’t tell you how much it helped my stamina and to view the test as sections rather than individual questions. It also helps you make quicker decisions on questions you don’t know so you can focus on some questions you can reason out. Just such a bad test. They need to get rid of it.|They remove all the bad questions, after the test has been taken. How intelligent right? Rather than making sure the test has fair questions before it is taken…. Genius.|Focus on vet school first. It mostly degrades your will to want to stay in academia. It is extremely toxic. If anything, surgery alone is the best speciality because you learn how to fix things and too many vets in the field refuse to do surgery for 1 not having the time, two not being able to charge appropriately, and 3 they can make more money doing rooms. Internal medicine you can teach yourself. Also…the schools rely on radiology to do the ultrasounds where in private practice, if you want to get anything done as an internist, you need to learn how to ultrasound and interpret yourself. So I would get ur DVM. Work for a year. Then go do an ultrasonography course  where they teach you in a group how to scan. Then study internal medicine yourself. Surgery though, you really gotta do the internship residency route. You still don’t have to get boarded. But you will have to publish some bs paper and waste that time. Unless you are able to find a mentor to teach you privately.|I wonder whos results they are.|I’m surprised how many vets accept a position with negative accrual.  With how many clinics need vets this should be something that can be removed from the system.  Vets have more leverage than employers do right now and it likely will stay that way for a long time.|This is called negative accrual, this is not standard in all contracts.  If it is on yours I would suggest negotiating it out or taking a different position.  There are too many open positions around the country to accept negative accrual as a norm in pay structures.

      "* Flights home to see family  / friends. Could cost at least $1K per trip minimum\n",
      "* Cost of living (food, housing, etc.) will be a lot higher in England than Baton Rouge\n",

      "- it’s not rolling in money. A good one will pay decent but you’re not gonna be rich\n",

      "- depending on the animal, you can get hurt but if you’re doing ur job right it won’t be severe. Just bites/scratches. It’s only a problem with rabies vectors but idk any professional who’s gotten bit and you have to have the vaccine to be able to work with them\n",

You will not get ANY training on wildlife in vet school. Being a zoo/exotics/wildlife vet requires you to be a comparative biologist. Take what we know/have for domestics and apply to the species you're working on. A lot of fact finding for papers to get protocols, etc... So having more knowledge of that work prior to your vet school experience will help you. It's a small field and hard to break into. If you're thinking capture and immobilization of let's say bears for research a lot of that is done with PhD's so maybe get in touch with a school that has a wildlife department and talk out best steps. If you're thinking rehabilitation, then you're typically doing that work on the side. If you're thinking zoo then you'll generally need a residency after vet school.|I work with wildlife so I don’t have to interact with owner ethics (thank god) but I remember in practice interviews in school they would give us situations like these and ask what we would do- very interesting discussion!|Just passed navle here. Took me three tries. I can’t tell u how brutal first and second year were because of anatomy and the lecture load. I felt the same. I would get a D and study harder only to get a C-.

You have to find ways to memorize shit with mneumonjcs and stuf that your brain wants to remember. Just know it’s there to prepare you for the amount of BS you need to force urself to study for navle. It may have 0 use in the clinic but some people believe it all makes sense by graduation; The anatomy first year, then pathology second year, clinics 3rd year, and electives 4th year with some more clinics.
