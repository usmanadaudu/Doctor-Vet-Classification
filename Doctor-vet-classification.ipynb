My question is what in the world caused that to happen? I love Mysterium but feel very sketched out, yet idk if it was even their fault. What do you guys think? I‚Äôm skeptical of reinstalling it again. I had a some MYST in my account prior to uninstalling, I doubt I would get it back if I reinstalled right? Not the end of the world, I‚Äôm just happy to be online again although I missed a lot of meetings this morning. Really curious how this happened after enabling the kill switch, quitting and uninstalling.

You think it‚Äôs safer going with residential nodes or no difference? ü•Ç ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tsbqed/security/i2wtq00/ | YES. Any more of a liability compared to something like ExpressVPN or any other popular centralized vpn? Given the nature of both i feel like it would be more prevalent with dVPNs but really don‚Äôt know ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tsbqed/security/i2wu0ju/ | Wow! Yeah seems the returns with Mysterium aren't great, I would have to enable whitelisting as well. Helium is a cool project. I wanted to buy a miner and antenna but all of the miners were sold out with a 6 month waiting period. I talked to this guy who does free installs but takes like 80% of the rewards which seemed pointless. Monero mining I don't know anything about. I don't have a mining rig either, just an iMac but I have no issue buying the equipment if the returns are steady ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tijvgl/best_ways_to_earn_supplemental_income_aside_from/i1ervof/ |  Yeah I think I am. Do you have any tips? I would be considered a noob but have good internet speeds and hardware. What kind of returns do you get? What are your thoughts on enabling whitelisting? Is it worthy the drop in MYST? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/thwllq/mysterium_vs_orchid/i1cbhz0/ | Lol fair enough. Hows the returns with presearch? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/thwllq/mysterium_vs_orchid/i1cvidl/ | Yeah it's bad. What's up with that? I hope they're at least working on something.
